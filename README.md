## Advanced Oil Price Forecasting System

Oil Prophet is a sophisticated forecasting system that combines advanced time-series decomposition techniques with deep learning (LSTM with attention mechanism) and alternative data sources to predict oil price movements with higher accuracy than traditional methods.

> ðŸš€ **Development Progress**: Core components including data processing, signal decomposition, forecasting models, and market sentiment analysis have been implemented and successfully tested. The system now supports visualization and evaluation of model performance.

## Features

### Implemented
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Robust data loading and preprocessing for multi-timeframe analysis
- **Signal Decomposition**: Time series decomposition into trend, cyclical, and residual components using advanced filtering techniques
- **LSTM with Attention Model**: Deep learning forecasting with attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence
- **Baseline Models**: Simple forecasting models for performance benchmarking
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines predictions from multiple models for more robust forecasts
- **Market Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis of oil-related discussions with simulated data
- **Sentiment-Enhanced Forecasting**: Integration of sentiment features with price data for improved prediction
- **Visualization System**: Comprehensive visualization tools for time series data, decomposition, forecasts, and model comparison
- **Evaluation Framework**: Rigorous model evaluation with multiple metrics and statistical significance testing

### Planned
- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Integration with Reddit API for live sentiment analysis
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web-based interface for exploring forecasts and model performance
- **API Development**: Exposing model predictions through a REST API

- **Risk Management**: Assisting companies in hedging strategies based on expected price movements
- **Budget Planning**: Supporting businesses in financial planning that depends on oil price forecasts
- **Market Research**: Providing insights into the relationship between market sentiment and oil prices

## Advanced Features

### Sentiment-Enhanced Forecasting

The system now successfully integrates sentiment data with price information, creating enhanced feature vectors for the LSTM model. This allows the model to capture both technical price patterns and market psychology, potentially improving prediction accuracy during periods of high market emotion.

![Price with Sentiment](notebooks/plots/price_with_sentiment.png)

The visualization above shows how oil prices (blue) correlate with market sentiment (red) and its 7-day moving average (green). Note how sentiment often leads price movements or reacts to sudden price changes.

### Enhanced Feature Creation

The demo generates enhanced feature vectors that combine:
- Historical price data (30-day windows)
- Sentiment compound scores
- Positive and negative sentiment ratios
- 7-day sentiment moving averages

These richer feature vectors provide the model with more context about market conditions during training, potentially leading to more accurate forecasts.
