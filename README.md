## Advanced Oil Price Forecasting System

Oil Prophet is a sophisticated forecasting system that combines advanced time-series decomposition techniques with deep learning (LSTM with attention mechanism) and market sentiment analysis to predict oil price movements with higher accuracy than traditional methods.

> ðŸš€ **Development Progress**: Core components including data processing, signal decomposition, forecasting models, and sentiment analysis integration have been implemented. Reddit historical scraping with comments is fully functional, and sentiment-enhanced LSTM model now successfully integrates market sentiment with price patterns. Interactive dashboard is currently under development.

## Sentiment Analysis Integration

The sentiment analysis pipeline now fully integrates with the forecasting models:

1. **FinBERT-Based Analysis**: Uses specialized financial BERT models pre-trained on financial texts for better sentiment understanding of oil market discussions.

2. **Domain Adaptation**: Implements oil market-specific term weighting to improve sentiment accuracy for industry terminology.

3. **Temporal Aggregation**: Aggregates sentiment by time period (daily, weekly, monthly) for alignment with price data.

4. **Feature Integration**: Combines sentiment features with price data in the input sequence for LSTM models.

5. **Performance Enhancement**: Testing shows improved forecasting accuracy, especially during periods of high market volatility or significant news events.

## Interactive Dashboard (In Development)

The interactive Streamlit dashboard is currently under development and includes:

1. **Forecast Explorer**: Compare predictions from different models, including sentiment-enhanced forecasts.

2. **Model Performance Analysis**: Evaluate and compare model performance with various metrics.

3. **Sentiment Analysis Visualization**: Explore the relationship between market sentiment and price movements.

4. **Signal Decomposition Analysis**: Visualize the components of price signals and their contributions.

**Note**: The dashboard is still in active development and may have stability issues. We're working to resolve these and improve the user experience.

## Applications

This forecasting system is valuable for:

- **Investment Decisions**: Helping investors make informed decisions for commodities trading
- **Risk Management**: Assisting companies in hedging strategies based on expected price movements
- **Budget Planning**: Supporting businesses in financial planning that depends on oil price forecasts
- **Market Research**: Providing insights into the relationship between market sentiment and oil prices

## Future Work

Our next major milestones include:

1. **Completing the Interactive Dashboard**: Finishing and stabilizing the Streamlit dashboard for easy exploration of forecasts and models.

2. **Historical News Data Collection**: Expanding data sources to include pre-Reddit era (1987-2008) news articles.

3. **API Development**: Building a REST API for integrating predictions with other systems.

4. **Forecast Uncertainty Quantification**: Adding confidence intervals and probability distributions to predictions.
