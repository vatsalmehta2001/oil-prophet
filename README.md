## Advanced Oil Price Forecasting System

Oil Prophet is a sophisticated forecasting system that combines advanced time-series decomposition techniques with deep learning (LSTM with attention mechanism) and alternative data sources to predict oil price movements with higher accuracy than traditional methods.

> ðŸš€ **Development Progress**: Core components including data processing, signal decomposition, forecasting models, and historical data scraping have been implemented and successfully tested. Reddit historical scraping with comments is now fully functional, and sentiment analysis integration is under active development.

## Data Collection Details

### Reddit Historical Scraper

The Reddit historical scraper collects data from financial subreddits with these key features:

1. **Post and Comment Collection**: For each relevant post, the scraper also collects all associated comments, providing a complete picture of the discussion.

2. **Relevance Filtering**: Uses keyword matching and relevance scoring to focus on oil-related content, with configurable relevance thresholds.

3. **Data Structure**:
   - Posts include title, text content, author, score, comment count, and creation date
   - Comments include text, author, score, parent post ID, and creation date
   - Relationship between posts and comments is maintained through post_id references

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Collects data from multiple subreddits focused on finance, investing, and economics to capture diverse perspectives.

5. **Historical Range**: Can collect data from Reddit's inception (2008) to present day.

6. **Quality Filters**: Includes options to filter by post score and comment quality to focus on significant discussions.

7. **Data Storage**: Saves data in both individual files per subreddit and a combined comprehensive dataset.

### Planned News Data Collection

To complement Reddit data (which only goes back to 2008), the system is being enhanced to collect historical news articles about oil markets from 1987-2008 using:

1. News archive APIs (NYTimes, etc.)
2. Financial news databases
3. Simulated historical data for periods with limited digital records

## Applications

This forecasting system is valuable for:

- **Investment Decisions**: Helping investors make informed decisions for commodities trading
- **Risk Management**: Assisting companies in hedging strategies based on expected price movements
- **Budget Planning**: Supporting businesses in financial planning that depends on oil price forecasts
- **Market Research**: Providing insights into the relationship between market sentiment and oil prices

## Current Development Focus

### Enhanced Sentiment Analysis

We're currently focused on improving the sentiment analysis component of the system:

1. **FinBERT Integration**: Implementing specialized financial BERT models that are pre-trained on financial texts for better sentiment understanding of oil market discussions.

2. **Comment-Level Sentiment Analysis**: Developing methods to analyze sentiment at the comment level and aggregate it for each discussion topic.

3. **Historical Data Coverage**: Working on methods to fill gaps in historical sentiment data, especially for the pre-Reddit era (1987-2008).

4. **Oil Market Domain Adaptation**: Adapting sentiment models to better understand oil-specific terminology and market dynamics.

5. **Multi-Source Sentiment Aggregation**: Developing methods to combine sentiment signals from multiple sources (Reddit, news, financial datasets).

6. **Temporal Sentiment Features**: Creating time-based sentiment features that can capture market sentiment shifts over different timeframes.

### Future Work

The next major milestone is to complete the sentiment analysis pipeline and integrate it with the forecasting models. This will allow the system to generate enhanced feature vectors that combine technical price patterns with market sentiment indicators, potentially improving prediction accuracy during periods of high market emotion.
