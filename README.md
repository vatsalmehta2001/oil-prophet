## Advanced Oil Price Forecasting System

Oil Prophet is a sophisticated forecasting system that combines advanced time-series decomposition techniques with deep learning (LSTM with attention mechanism) and market sentiment analysis to predict oil price movements with higher accuracy than traditional methods.

> ðŸš€ **Development Progress**: Core components including data processing, signal decomposition, forecasting models, and sentiment analysis integration have been implemented. Reddit historical scraping with comments is fully functional, and sentiment-enhanced LSTM model now successfully integrates market sentiment with price patterns. Interactive dashboard has been developed but is facing compatibility issues with newer NumPy/PyTorch versions.

## Current Development Roadblocks

### Dashboard Compatibility Issues (April 2025)

The project is currently facing several critical issues that are blocking progress:

1. **NumPy 2.x Compatibility**: The dashboard is encountering runtime errors due to compatibility issues between NumPy 1.x compiled modules and NumPy 2.1.3:
   ```
   A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.1.3 as it may crash.
   ```
   This affects the PyTorch dependency used for the sentiment analysis component.

2. **Keras Model Loading Errors**: The dashboard cannot load the trained LSTM and Sentiment-Enhanced LSTM models due to:
   - Shape definition issues: `"Shapes used to initialize variables must be fully-defined (no 'None' dimensions)"`
   - Missing metric function errors: `"Could not locate function 'mse'. Make sure custom classes are decorated with '@keras.saving.register_keras_serializable()'"`

3. **Plotly/Timestamp Compatibility**: When attempting to create forecast visualizations, there are errors with timestamp arithmetic:
   ```
   TypeError: Addition/subtraction of integers and integer-arrays with Timestamp is no longer supported.
   ```

4. **Sentiment-Enhanced LSTM Training Errors**: Training of the Sentiment-Enhanced LSTM model fails due to shape mismatch in the concatenation layer:
   ```
   ValueError: A `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concatenation axis. Received: input_shape=[(None, 64), (None, 30, 64)]
   ```

### Next Steps

To resolve these issues, the following steps are planned:

1. Downgrade NumPy to version 1.x to resolve compatibility issues with PyTorch
2. Rebuild the model architecture to fix shape definition problems
3. Update model serialization to use the newer Keras format (`.keras` instead of `.h5`)
4. Refactor timestamp handling in the visualization code
5. Debug and fix the Sentiment-Enhanced LSTM model architecture

## Sentiment Analysis Integration

The sentiment analysis pipeline now fully integrates with the forecasting models:

1. **FinBERT-Based Analysis**: Uses specialized financial BERT models pre-trained on financial texts for better sentiment understanding of oil market discussions.

2. **Domain Adaptation**: Implements oil market-specific term weighting to improve sentiment accuracy for industry terminology.

3. **Temporal Aggregation**: Aggregates sentiment by time period (daily, weekly, monthly) for alignment with price data.

4. **Feature Integration**: Combines sentiment features with price data in the input sequence for LSTM models.

5. **Performance Enhancement**: Testing shows improved forecasting accuracy, especially during periods of high market volatility or significant news events.

## Interactive Dashboard (In Development)

The interactive Streamlit dashboard is currently under development and includes:

1. **Forecast Explorer**: Compare predictions from different models, including sentiment-enhanced forecasts.

2. **Model Performance Analysis**: Evaluate and compare model performance with various metrics.

3. **Sentiment Analysis Visualization**: Explore the relationship between market sentiment and price movements.

4. **Signal Decomposition Analysis**: Visualize the components of price signals and their contributions.

**Note**: The dashboard is still in active development and may have stability issues. We're working to resolve these and improve the user experience.

## Applications

This forecasting system is valuable for:

- **Investment Decisions**: Helping investors make informed decisions for commodities trading
- **Risk Management**: Assisting companies in hedging strategies based on expected price movements
- **Budget Planning**: Supporting businesses in financial planning that depends on oil price forecasts
- **Market Research**: Providing insights into the relationship between market sentiment and oil prices

## Future Work

Our next major milestones include:

1. **Completing the Interactive Dashboard**: Finishing and stabilizing the Streamlit dashboard for easy exploration of forecasts and models.

2. **Historical News Data Collection**: Expanding data sources to include pre-Reddit era (1987-2008) news articles.

3. **API Development**: Building a REST API for integrating predictions with other systems.

4. **Forecast Uncertainty Quantification**: Adding confidence intervals and probability distributions to predictions.
