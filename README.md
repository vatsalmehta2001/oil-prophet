## Advanced Oil Price Forecasting System

Oil Prophet is a sophisticated forecasting system that combines advanced time-series decomposition techniques with deep learning (LSTM with attention mechanism) and alternative data sources to predict oil price movements with higher accuracy than traditional methods.

> ðŸš€ **Development Progress**: Core components including data processing, signal decomposition, forecasting models, and historical data scraping have been implemented and successfully tested. Reddit historical scraping is now functional, and sentiment analysis integration is under active development.

## Features

### Implemented
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Robust data loading and preprocessing for multi-timeframe analysis
- **Signal Decomposition**: Time series decomposition into trend, cyclical, and residual components using advanced filtering techniques
- **LSTM with Attention Model**: Deep learning forecasting with attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence
- **Baseline Models**: Simple forecasting models for performance benchmarking
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines predictions from multiple models for more robust forecasts
- **Enhanced Reddit Historical Scraper**: Comprehensive system for collecting oil-related discussions from Reddit spanning from 2008 to present
- **Data Coverage Visualization**: Tools to analyze and visualize the coverage of collected data across different time periods
- **Visualization System**: Comprehensive visualization tools for time series data, decomposition, forecasts, and model comparison
- **Evaluation Framework**: Rigorous model evaluation with multiple metrics and statistical significance testing

### In Progress
- **Sentiment Analysis Integration**: Currently enhancing FinBERT-based sentiment analysis for oil market-specific content
- **Historical News Data Collection**: Working on methods to collect pre-Reddit era (1987-2008) news articles
- **Sentiment-Enhanced Forecasting**: Integrating sentiment features with price data for improved prediction accuracy

### Planned
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web-based interface for exploring forecasts and model performance
- **API Development**: Exposing model predictions through a REST API

- **Risk Management**: Assisting companies in hedging strategies based on expected price movements
- **Budget Planning**: Supporting businesses in financial planning that depends on oil price forecasts
- **Market Research**: Providing insights into the relationship between market sentiment and oil prices

## Current Development Focus

### Enhanced Sentiment Analysis

We're currently focused on improving the sentiment analysis component of the system:

1. **FinBERT Integration**: Implementing specialized financial BERT models that are pre-trained on financial texts for better sentiment understanding of oil market discussions.

2. **Historical Data Coverage**: Working on methods to fill gaps in historical sentiment data, especially for the pre-Reddit era (1987-2008).

3. **Oil Market Domain Adaptation**: Adapting sentiment models to better understand oil-specific terminology and market dynamics.

4. **Multi-Source Sentiment Aggregation**: Developing methods to combine sentiment signals from multiple sources (Reddit, news, financial datasets).

5. **Temporal Sentiment Features**: Creating time-based sentiment features that can capture market sentiment shifts over different timeframes.

### Future Work

The next major milestone is to complete the sentiment analysis pipeline and integrate it with the forecasting models. This will allow the system to generate enhanced feature vectors that combine technical price patterns with market sentiment indicators, potentially improving prediction accuracy during periods of high market emotion.
