## Advanced Oil Price Forecasting System

Oil Prophet is a sophisticated forecasting system that combines advanced time-series decomposition techniques with deep learning (LSTM with attention mechanism) and alternative data sources to predict oil price movements with higher accuracy than traditional methods.

> ðŸš€ **Development Progress**: Core components including data processing, signal decomposition, and forecasting models have been implemented. The system now supports visualization and evaluation of model performance.

## Features

### Implemented
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Robust data loading and preprocessing for multi-timeframe analysis
- **Signal Decomposition**: Time series decomposition into trend, cyclical, and residual components using advanced filtering techniques
- **LSTM with Attention Model**: Deep learning forecasting with attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence
- **Baseline Models**: Simple forecasting models for performance benchmarking
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines predictions from multiple models for more robust forecasts
- **Visualization System**: Comprehensive visualization tools for time series data, decomposition, forecasts, and model comparison
- **Evaluation Framework**: Rigorous model evaluation with multiple metrics and statistical significance testing

### Planned
- **Market Sentiment Integration**: Analyzing sentiment from Reddit financial communities to incorporate market psychology
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Web-based interface for exploring forecasts and model performance
- **API Development**: Exposing model predictions through a REST API
