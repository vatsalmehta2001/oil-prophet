jepn69l,129pcf4,comment,reddit,stocks,"Biden & his administration have been trying to drive oil prices down by releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, pressuring other countries to produce more, approving more oil fields to open. 

The problem is that prices are climbing because of increasing and historic levels of energy demand. There is no emphasis on restraint of energy consumption, or consumption of any type. 

In this situation, the only restraint on energy consumption IS high prices. This is why environmentalists have been trying to shut down oil fields and restrict production all these years. High energy prices are the cure for excessive energy demand.

By increasing production and suppressing oil & gas prices, Biden is engaging in straight up climate change denier policy, and promoting more energy consumption.

> I guarantee you 100% you people would be blaming him for higher prices if he didn't do what he did.

Of course they would. Because online communities are only for climate change mitigation when it consists of promoting Tesla & EVs and other cool technology.

kbvdt78,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,"> Oil producers outside OPEC+ are pumping oil at record levels and can now cover global demand, which which has forced the Saudi-led alliance to cut to keep the market balanced in their favor, according to Kaneva. 

The two-part problem for the OPEC+ cartel is going to be difficult for them to navigate:

* Member nations need a certain level of oil revenue/profits to balance their own national budgets. Russia is close to trying to fund a total war off of oil revenue, and Nigeria/Angola can't afford to hold back production. Saudi Arabia can voluntarily cut revenue enough to keep prices high, but then they don't get the benefit of high prices when they're not selling enough volume. All the other OPEC and OPEC+ countries need that combination of price and volume to balance their budgets, so they're all hoping that other nations' voluntary cuts support the prices necessary, without having to sacrifice their own volume.
* Producers in non-member nations (and member nations that don't obey the quotas) can free-ride off of OPEC+'s price manipulation to get high volume at high prices. The United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Brazil, Norway, and Kazakhstan are producing a bunch of oil, and its producers love when the Saudis push prices up. (And even though Brazil and Kazakhstan are sometimes geopolitically aligned with OPEC+, that's offset by the fact that OPEC member nation Iraq ignores quotas).

As long as non-OPEC+ production capacity remains high, the OPEC+ nations can't effectively manipulate prices, which will cause dissent within its own ranks.",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18a09bh/saudi_arabia_is_struggling_to_boost_oil_prices/kbvdt78/,Already-Price-Tin,68,1701640733.0,2023-12-03 21:58:53,t3_18a09bh,False,inherited

In fact the royal families are so deeply entrenched into the country that removing the royal family would destroy the country in the process. Any family that is at risk will have the US come and support it.

Also, and i say this because I used to consult with a B4 in MENA, theres absolutely no way those countries are falling without bringing down the entire world with them. PIF / Mubadala basically funded Silicon Valley and have controlling ownership stakes inultiple large companies across the world. Hell the largest refinery on the US is Saudi owned via Aramco. DP world, UAE GRE, has a controlling share in many important western and eastern ports. These are only a slice of control the GCC have.

Also, Iran's power is limited due to how important of a strategic ally the GCC is for the US / NATO / Europe. There's alot of anti-GCC stuff on reddit but it'd be foolish to think that the GCC does not have a chokehold on the global economy and the world will protect the GCC to maintain status quo. There's a reason that the US has the largest military base in ME in Qatar. It has alot to do with how important the GCC is to maintain economic stability. E.g. Should the GCC depeg its currency from the USD, the consequences will be disastrous.

kbv9mp9,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,I I’m 50 percent on a couple and down 30 percent on a couple. Dividend are great though. Just a bit nervous with my exposure.

kbzdhm3,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,I yolo'd back into cvx after the acquisition dip.. They're more exposed to oil price fluctuations now but they're planning on increasing buy backs and up dividends even more so..

kbuttjh,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,"It’s a decades long process my man. It doesn’t happen overnight.  It’s really clear what’s happening and the fact you are so obsessed with the short term shows your ignorance.  

People are looking at our long term bonds for first time in my life and like…no thanks.  Not that there won’t be a blow up in the dollar because of all this dollar denominated debt as other countries look elsewhere in the short term, but after that will be ugly if they don’t want it anymore, and we continue this path this will be the case, it’s not even arguable except by neolibs who think tomorrow will always look like yesterday because they don’t know their history and they don’t want to believe the facts.  All this happens so slow that they just keep convincing themselves otherwise.  

Wealth inequality and deficit spending will be the end of America, just line many empires before it.  It takes some real American exceptionalism brain to believe otherwise",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18a09bh/saudi_arabia_is_struggling_to_boost_oil_prices/kbuttjh/,Holiday_Extent_5811,1,1701633498.0,2023-12-03 19:58:18,t1_kbus52t,False,inherited
