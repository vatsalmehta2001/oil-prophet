>Oil giant Shell is doubling down on its focus on fossil fuel profits and attracting investors by announcing plans to increase shareholder payouts and reduce capital investment.

While expanding its liquefied natural gas business, Shell will also invest in ""low carbon"" technologies such as biofuels, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging, and carbon capture and storage.

>Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, emphasized the company's commitment to providing secure energy while transforming to thrive in a low-carbon future. The goal is to create profitable business models that can be rapidly scaled to impact global energy system decarbonization. However, Shell's decision to prioritize fossil fuel investments has faced criticism from investors like the Church of England's pension funds and climate groups who accuse the company of neglecting renewable energy opportunities.

In a dramatic and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers have announced a series of cuts. This powerful alliance includes heavyweight oil producers like Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, and Algeria.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has pledged to reduce its oil output by a massive 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May until the end of 2023, in a move described by the Saudi energy ministry as a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market"". Joining the colossal effort, Russia's deputy prime minister declared that Moscow would also extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023.

Other key players in the OPEC+ alliance have stepped up with their own production cuts. The United Arab Emirates plans to cut 144,000 bpd, Kuwait with 128,000 bpd, Iraq by 211,000 bpd, Oman with 40,000 bpd, and Algeria to reduce output by 48,000 bpd. Collectively, these substantial reductions demonstrate the alliance's dedication to fostering a stable and balanced oil market.

„ÄêHow to Respond to Russia's Oil Production Cut„Äë

Earlier we discussed OPEC and individual oil-producing countries' lack of willingness to increase production, and even their desire to reduce production. After all, increasing production means further suppressing oil prices, while reducing production means indicating weak demand. Therefore, the joint production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia to some extent demonstrates uncertainty in demand growth and concerns about economic recession.

Compared with the potential inflation caused by reducing production, oil, as the lifeblood of industry, affects people's daily lives worldwide. Investors should be more concerned about the impact of this OPEC production cut on economic activity. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is equivalent to a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which will also suppress economic activity. Economic recession means limited room for oil price increases. Therefore, long positions in crude oil should be cautious, constantly monitoring whether oil prices break below support levels, and paying attention to shifts in the long-short style.

However, for US oil stocks, it's a win-win situation. The production cost of US shale oil is between $40-50 per barrel. US oil companies can both legitimately increase production and sell at a good price, and act as a vanguard during economic recovery. In this situation, oil stocks' buyback performance and dividend payouts are good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12fhlry/next_weeks_trading_410414_how_to_deal_with_oil/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12fhlry/next_weeks_trading_410414_how_to_deal_with_oil/,MontedCristo,11,16,1680948699.0,2023-04-08 10:11:39,True,0.9615805604203154,high
14kihdk,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Here's why oil has gone down for the past year, despite OPEC cuts and so many factors, and why people calling $100+/barrel got it so wrong.","For those who have followed me, you may remember my post last year warning people not to go too bullish on OPEC's cuts. I explained why they were smoke and mirror. Why you shouldn't expect any return to $122 prices. And why oil prices were actually more likely to go down. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w25s6z/oil\_had\_a\_great\_run\_but\_it\_may\_be\_time\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w25s6z/oil_had_a_great_run_but_it_may_be_time_to/)

And again with the more recent cuts. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people\_betting\_on\_oil\_stocks\_now\_because\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people_betting_on_oil_stocks_now_because_of_the/)

Now oil prices have slipped under $70.

Why have oil prices gone down for a year, when demand is supposed to have picked up with the supply chain and cruises back up, people flying and traveling again, China ending its lockdowns, the energy crisis, sanctions on Russia, and OPEC cutting its outputs?

It's a much more complex picture than that.

You have to look at all the factors at play, the context, the timing, and what's really happening. 

In the first post I explained a lot of the underlying factors that bullish people might have overlooked. 

You have to look at not just what the OPEC output targets are, but what the countries are actually producing. And everything in between from the supply chain to the refineries. 

If people who had called $100+ had looked at those, they would have instead had more expectations below $90. 

# But let's look at the present situation.

There's a ton of factors, and I recommend doing your own research and looking at each one yourself. It's a complex picture, with many moving parts. 

But one of the factors worth mentioning is Russia having to desperately unload its oil for cheap and flooding the market. On top of the gap between output and target cuts, this has also negated any of the few OPEC countries that had any real changes in output.

However, after a year of being bearish on oil prices, I'm no longer as bearish as I once was.

But I'm not bullish yet, just a little less bearish. I just think the downtrend will slow and stabilize. 

...barring any recession, housing market crash, wild OPEC shift, that could re-accelerate the downtrend. 

And that's a big if. Since I'm not feeling positive about the housing market right now, and can really see a correction. That could potentially affect the market demand. 

Plus we are currently in the prime season for oil demand. We'll be heading into the weaker months at the end of the year. 

I can see the downtrend slowing and stabilizing at best. But I'm still not seeing a big come back, or oil prices back above $100 this year.

Maybe next year oil bulls. 

# The stock side

We could however see more positives for the stock side in the energy industry.

This is where I might be even less bearish, and slightly becoming bullish. 

Looking beyond just the commodity side itself, the industry related stocks have actually not been doing that bad, all things considered. XOM, CVX, and Shell, have had somewhat of a stable trend to a mild downward trend for the past year. Smaller stock in things like oil exploration, shale industry, etc... have been a little more volatile. 

If you believe the current stock market rally is part of a long term trend for a next bull cycle, and not a bull trap, then the oil industry related stocks might be worth looking into. There is a potential for a much more positive oil market next year, and maybe more stability as early as this year. 

You also have to believe that there is no further threat of recession or some housing market crash.

And you have to believe that we're not quiet there yet with renewable energy, with electric cars, and that China, India, and Brazil will outpace that with high demand for a lot of fossil fuel vehicles.

13zgpuc,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,OPEC+'s Challenge: Sustaining Oil Prices While Avoiding Disputes,"OPEC+ is striving to sustain oil prices while avoiding disputes. Interestingly, as soon as the group stopped holding monthly meetings, prices immediately spiraled out of control.

Indeed, there's no one to blame here, as circumstances beyond the member‚Äôs‚Äô contract have unfolded unfavorably. But it's still quite amusing.

Just two months ago, they had to hastily cut production without holding any meeting. The move was dramatic, but short-lived.

So, why not try it again?

Last week, Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman [cautioned short-sellers against betting on a decline](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13qkuaj/i_keep_warning_them_that_they_will_be_hurting/), hinting at potential action. But it's not as simple as it seems.

Real production cuts only began in May, and the impact has not yet been felt. Bloomberg calculated that OPEC's production has fallen by only 0.5 million bpd relative to April, and by 1 million bpd relative to February.

This is less than the 1.2 million bpd announced in April (formally it was 2 million, but part of it was simply a shortfall of quotas). Even so, disregarding the slump during the pandemic, OPEC's production is at its lowest level since the crisis year of 2009.

As early as last fall, not everyone considered cuts to be a good idea. The UAE was unhappy that they were not able to utilize their recently upgraded production capabilities. At the moment, 30% of UAE capacity is sitting idle, a figure even larger than Iran‚Äôs.

There are also questions among OPEC+ members regarding the pace of cuts, and the discussion at the meeting promises to be heated.

Raising prices would be beneficial. But announcing a reduction that will not be implemented is risky. It could undermine the group‚Äôs credibility and influence. And the further the ordered cuts go, the harder it will be to achieve agreement and discipline within the cartel.

I suspect that if another cut is necessary, an agreement will be reached. But it's unlikely to happen tomorrow. The situation just isn‚Äôt tat dire‚Äîat least, it isn‚Äôt yet. Prices have been rising for two days, short-sellers are reducing their risks just in case, and overall market optimism has increased.

I expect that tomorrow OPEC will limit itself to verbal interventions. **WTI prices will not stray far from $70 and will return to that level within one to two weeks.** Volatility will decrease.

If production is indeed cut, we might see a jump to $80, but this would look like an all-in from OPEC. They would have to hope for a recovery in Chinese demand. Otherwise, a deeper fall is inevitable, and there won't be tools to contain it‚Äã.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13zgpuc/opecs_challenge_sustaining_oil_prices_while/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13zgpuc/opecs_challenge_sustaining_oil_prices_while/,bitkogan,17,12,1685807202.0,2023-06-03 15:46:42,True,1.0,high

Oil price at the time of that post : $91.

&#x200B;

**Why did the price go down when OPEC made production cuts?**

It was in essence a quota cut not a production cut.

They were already more than a couple of million barrels a day behind their existing quota. Thanks to many OPEC countries being behind. Countries like Libya that had geopolitical problems that shut down nearly their entire oil production. Problems that were resolved at the time of the cut when rebels lifted their blockades. There were a lot more supply and demand shifts. From China, to supply chain, etc...

All this meant that oil output actually increased, despite the ""cuts"" officially declared on paper.

&#x200B;

**This isn't coming from hindsight 20/20.**

I explained this 7 months ago: [https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people\_betting\_on\_oil\_stocks\_now\_because\_of\_the/](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people_betting_on_oil_stocks_now_because_of_the/)

**If unsure about oil, follow inverse Cramer:**

Oil is fickle and has many moving parts that you have to keep an eye on. And at the end of the day, it's a cartel, with many geopolitical elements that can ignite surprises.

Maybe next month oil will finally go sky high past $100.

But what's still reliable is inverse Cramer. Keep on eye out on what he says about oil.

He was bullish on ""oil dips"" 11 months ago when the price was over $100.

12adqvv,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,Goldilocks is walking away. OPEC+ move reignited fears over inflation and growth,"Just as investors putting the banking crisis behind, OPEC+'s surprise decision to cut production reignited fears of sustained inflation and a potentially prolonged rate hike cycle of central banks.

Strategists believe stocks are likely to drop as higher oil prices from the production cut crimp growth. However, they said the market may struggle to price in expectations of further Fed rate hikes.

US dollar rose against all major currencies except the currencies of oil suppliers Norway and Canada, reflecting market bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates further.

Traders expect the Fed to have about a 60% chance of another rate hike at its May policy meeting, up from 56% on Friday. They expect the Fed to cut borrowing costs by the end of the year, the data showed.

Rude Awakening

‚ÄúThe OPEC+ production cut is another reminder that the inflation genie is not back in the bottle,‚Äù said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard Ltd. in New York.¬†He believes this move increases the risk of more persistent inflation, and ‚Äúit also likely limits the latitude central banks might have to relax monetary policy even if the economy slows.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor equity investors, this could be a rude awakening, as markets imply a Goldilocks outlook of reduced discount rates but no recession. Bond markets have been more sober in assessing recession risk, but perhaps too optimistic in terms of the likely central bank response to weakening growth. Today‚Äôs decision makes the outlook more complex for investors across the board.‚Äù

Fed Dilemma

‚ÄúSince inflation is likely to remain the biggest driver of the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy, the market will be less likely to assume an early shift to lower rates or a faster pace of rate cuts,‚Äù said Hidehiro Joke, a strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. ‚ÄúHowever, the OPEC+ production cut report alone is unlikely to foster expectations of a prolonged rate hike, as was the case prior to the recent financial turmoil. Therefore, it will be difficult for the market to aggressively price in an additional rate hikes by the Fed.‚Äù

Growth Drag

‚ÄúStocks will trade lower today,‚Äù said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG Australia. ‚ÄúComing on top of the fallout of the banking crisis which is expected to lead to tighter credit and slower growth, higher energy prices will also weigh on growth and likely to take some of the steam out of last weeks rebound in equity markets.‚Äù

Oil Bulls

The production cuts are bullish for oil and ‚Äúwill help to drive Brent faster back to $100 per barrel as global jet fuel demand revives,‚Äù Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AG. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to cut when there is limited risk for loss of market share to US shale oil as growth there slows. More market power to OPEC+ and higher oil prices is the natural consequence of fading US shale oil growth.‚Äù

16uqyi0,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,Oil's Pricey Future: Decoding the Saudi Strategy and Market Dynamics,"Almost no one but me appears to doubt that, if major suppliers (read: the Saudis) do in fact persist with their supply cuts, oil will surpass $100 again.

From the Saudi perspective, the math is simple. Why sell 7 million barrels a day (their exports from a year ago) at $70 when you can offload 5.5 million (exports in August) for $100 or more?

Saudi logic stands clear, and their short-term supply shock strategy seems to be working flawlessly.

But what lies ahead?

Demand is dwindling, while at the same time, supply outside the cartel keeps expanding. For the past three weeks, US production has consistently hovered around 12.9 million barrels per day‚Äîa spike of 640,000 barrels over the average during the first half of the year.

Consequently, to sustain these prices, Saudi Arabia might need to enforce even more drastic production cuts. This will reduce both their revenue and their market influence.

Political risks loom large too. The cartel's gains are essentially deductions from the consumer's wallet. Almost no one is thrilled with the present dynamic, and it might even be bad enough to inspire the creation of NOPEC.

In a nutshell, I'm skeptical about long-term price ascension. That‚Äôs precisely why the recent price correction in oil, juxtaposed against rising stock levels, doesn't astonish me. Oddly enough, for October, I'd rather see prices gravitating towards $100. It would ensure my bearish hedge operates at its peak¬†efficiency.
