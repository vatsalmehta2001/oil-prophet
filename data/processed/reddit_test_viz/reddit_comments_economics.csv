jenzzug,129ngl7,comment,reddit,Economics,"*OPEC+ announced a surprise oil production cut that will exceed 1 million barrels a day, curtailing supply from May despite a recovery in prices from 15-month lows.*
*Saudi Arabia led the cartel by pledging its own 500,000 barrel-a-day supply reduction. Fellow members including Kuwait, the United Arabia Emirates and Algeria followed suit, while Russia said the production cut it was implementing from March to June would continue until the end of the 2023.*
*That means, starting in May, there will be about 1 million barrels a day less crude flowing into the market than previously expected.*

There's a reason we don't hear about fracking anymore. (It's too unprofitable to do anymore because of the EROI)

Edit: Yes the Permian Basin exists in America. It's ubiquitous there and other major oil exporting sites. We used to see fracking outside of major oil and gas deposits. Unless there's an immense amount present there's no reason to frack without a sizeable return on the investment in doing so.

We need to remember the time in which fracking [killed it's own market during the 2010's to right before covid.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/01/1027822/fracking-boom-jobs-industry/)

Remember every BEV removes 10 barrels per year. Which is not much. But last year 1 in 14 new US vehicles was BEV. Higher in Europe and coming on strong in China. 

So now that millions of new cars are BEVs and the older less efficient ICE vehicles are coming off line and the largest group of people in world history is retiring (world wide baby boomers this decade) which lowers total miles per year per vehicle. So putting them all together we are seeing a small but rising trend of oil use reduction. 

How fast is anyone's guess but it's happening and more and more it will slow new investments and reduce the grip of oil on the world economy. 

Normally I don't buy into this stuff. But when I see the majors investing in renewables and selling off or writing down harder to reach oil reserves I suspect they know something.

Saudi Arabia is preparing to prolong oil production cuts into next year as Opec+ weighs further reductions in response to falling prices and rising anger over the Israel-Hamas war.

After prices hit a four-month low of $77 a barrel this week, four people familiar with the Saudi government’s thinking said it was highly likely to extend its 1mn barrel-a-day cut at least until the spring.

The voluntary measure, due to expire at the end of this year, was introduced in the summer as a temporary step on top of wider cuts by the oil cartel. At present, Saudi Arabia produces about 9mn b/d, compared with a maximum of about 12mn b/d.

Further cuts, which could inflame tensions with the US, are under discussion by Opec+ as it prepares to meet in Vienna on November 26.

While the oil price drop is the main cause, members are also indignant at Israel’s war on Hamas and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

An additional Opec+ cut of up to 1mn b/d could be on the table, one informed person said, describing the cartel as “galvanised” by the conflict.

Kuwait, Algeria and Iran are among the Opec members most agitated by the conflict.

“You should not underestimate the level of anger there is and the pressure leaders in the Gulf feel from their populations to be seen to respond in some manner,” said another person close to senior Opec figures in the Gulf.

The person said there would be no repeat of the oil shock of the 1970s, when Arab states halted exports to the west. But they added: “People have become complacent about the potential to tighten oil supplies to send a subtle message, which will be well understood both in the streets and Washington DC.”

US President Joe Biden is facing a difficult re-election battle next year, possibly against his predecessor Donald Trump, and the White House is already struggling to convince voters that the country’s economy is healthy.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/17xmx0i/opec_weighs_further_oil_production_cuts_as_anger/k9o9rhd/,MaleficentParfait863,15,1700249331.0,2023-11-17 19:28:51,t3_17xmx0i,True,inherited

k9o9s89,17xmx0i,comment,reddit,Economics,"The people close to Saudi Arabia’s thinking stressed that no final decision had yet been made. They emphasised that any public statements by Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, would keep the focus on the oil market, rather than the Israel-Hamas war.

Prince Abdulaziz recently hit out at hedge funds that have increased their bets against oil, amid expectations that the market may move into a small surplus next year because of the weak global economy and rising supplies outside Opec.

Christian Malek at JPMorgan said Opec+ could carry out an additional 1mn b/d cut to pre-empt “potential demand weakness” in the first half of next year, with Saudi Arabia looking to other members to “share the load” of any further cuts.

Other analysts suggested that Prince Abdulaziz could push other countries to deepen cuts — or comply with past commitments to reduce production — by threatening that Saudi Arabia could shift back towards full production unless such steps are taken.

Russia, an Opec+ member that depends heavily on oil to finance its invasion of Ukraine, has been increasing seaborne exports in recent months.

The economic reform programme of Prince Abdulaziz’s half-brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman requires an oil price close to $100 a barrel, analysts maintain. The plan ranges from building hypermodern cities to hosting the 2034 football World Cup.

But some experts suggested Opec+ members will proceed cautiously, mindful of their growing role on the international stage. The United Arab Emirates, which hosts the UN COP28 climate talks in Dubai this month, is keen to portray itself as a modernising force.

“This is an incredibly delicate time in the Middle East,” said Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst and head of RBC Capital Markets commodities research.

“While the oil market has largely discounted the conflict spreading, there are still major risks, particularly on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon where a confrontation with Hizbollah could bring Iran into the conflict.”",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/17xmx0i/opec_weighs_further_oil_production_cuts_as_anger/k9o9s89/,MaleficentParfait863,13,1700249340.0,2023-11-17 19:29:00,t1_k9o9rhd,True,inherited

The Interior Department announced its final drilling plan for offshore oil and gas leasing over the next five years on Friday, setting three further lease sales between 2024 and 2029.  
  
The federal government is required to lease at least 60 million acres for oil and gas exploration as a condition of issuing offshore wind power leases under the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.  
  
In the final plan, the department set a lease sale in the Outer Continental Shelf for 2025, with another to follow in 2027 and a third in 2029.  
  
Industry trade group the American Petroleum Institute (API) criticized the plan as a “step in the wrong direction” in a statement.  
  
“Simply put, this final 5-year program fails to meet the energy needs of the American people and could threaten to increase reliance on foreign energy sources,” Holly Hopkins, API’s vice president of upstream policy, said in a statement.  
  
“Demand for affordable, reliable energy is only growing, yet the administration is choosing to limit future production in a region that plays a critical role in powering our nation and supplies among the lowest carbon-intensive barrels in the world,” Hopkins added.  
  
Environmental groups also took issue with the plan, with the ocean conservation groups hitting the administration for allowing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
“This Five-Year Plan started with President Trump proposing to open nearly all U.S. waters to offshore oil drilling and ends with President Biden’s final plan that is the smallest to date,” Beth Lowell, Oceana’s vice president for the United States, wrote in a statement.

jcy4g41,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"All of the media outlets framing this as a simple tradeoff between inflation vs bank stability are vastly oversimplifying the issue.  We're a decade late in unwinding ZIRP/QE and if the Fed flinches because a few banks are in trouble they will cause themselves a far bigger problem a few years down the road.  The Fed needs to get both the financial system and the economy overall back to an environment where real rates are positive and risk is priced appropriately.  15 years of ZIRP/QE have introduced all sorts of distortions that are going to be painful to fix, but waiting will make it worse.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcy4g41/,FuguSandwich,1903,1679319065.0,2023-03-20 13:31:05,t3_11wgwz8,False,inherited
jcxzigt,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"The Fed sets interest rates higher in order to slow down the economy. They do this because inflation is too high, and by reducing demand in the economy they can help bring prices down (ie slowing inflation).

To an average Joe, the higher interest rate means that loans will be more expensive (higher interest) on things like mortgages, credit cards, car loans, etc. It also means that businesses may decide to cancel projects because it's too expensive to borrow the money now. For example, a business that was going to use loans to build a new factory may cancel that project or put it on hold. As a result, this can mean less jobs and/or layoffs by some businesses. This results in a tighter budget for some working class Americans.

The upside is that this also means less spending, which means stores are going to have to keep their prices lower to attract customers. That helps keep inflation under control, which is a benefit to American workers.

Long story short, the Fed is trying to get inflation under control by slowing down the economy. They do this by raising interest rates. The ongoing debate is *how fast* to raise the rates and how high to raise them. If they go too fast, they could send the economy into severe recession. If they go too slow, inflation could keep getting higher.

The 0.25% raise is basically what everyone is expecting this month. If the Fed doesn't raise at all this month, it signals they are going to let inflation run higher because they're worried about the recent bank turmoil. If they raise it 0.5%, it means they're willing to risk more bank issues (and more market turmoil) in order to get inflation under control.

The Fed meets 8 times per year to decide whether to adjust interest rates. A single rate adjustment really isn't going to have any noticeable effect on the average Joe American. However, the cumulative total of all the rate adjustments will significantly impact the economy. Everyone in the financial world gets worked up about each new rate adjustment because they want to try to predict what it means for the future. It's sort of like a person keeping track of a basketball game on their phone. They want to know when each team scores, and they celebrate or get upset each time. However, each score doesn't really matter - it's the cumulative effect that actually affects the outcome of the game. Likewise, each individual rate adjustment doesn't mean much to the average Joe, but the financial professionals are watching it closely, just like how a basketball fan might watch the whole game, but a less interested person just wants to know who won.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcxzigt/,Dubs13151,1273,1679316611.0,2023-03-20 12:50:11,t1_jcxwj03,False,inherited

Brilliant my dude. Couldn't have said it better. And you even touched on servicing that debt. 5% of 30 trillion is one thing, 5% of 300 trillion is a whole other ballgame. Especially when you consider spending and tax revenues being nowhere near enough to manage those debts.

jcyrg54,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"> Global aggregate debt went from 70 trillion in 2007 to around 300 trillion today.  That 230 trillion in debt funded only 40 trillion in global GDP growth.

While this sounds bad, that's sort of how debt-financed GDP growth works. That *may* be an acceptable tradeoff. You're only really concerned about servicing the debt payments, so as long as taxes (to service the loans) from that GDP growth is greater than the payments, it's a ""net win. The issue today is that, with rising interest rates, it becomes harder and harder to service that debt based on the GDP growth.

The role of the central bank is to set monetary policy through their relationship with banks and the treasury which both collectively underpin the movement and flows of money.

jcywr5k,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"How can you fix a system economically that preys on the population, gives money to the rich, and leaves the poor to fend for themselves? How do you fix a system that has corruption built into it. Where big money siphoning is hard to track.and covered up? From CEOs to politicians? How can you fix a system that is this corrupt and constantly in crisis? How can we fix a system where no one at the top has the best interests of the Working Class in mind?

Fascism is caused by capitalism in decline. As a way to continue capitalism. Capitalism will always end with fascism if we don't figure out a new system that gives power to the ground up, not top down.

America is destined to become fascist. It is destined to break down and fall. Capitalism cannot continue. Capitalism needs to grow, devour resources, eat and profit. When there is nowhere else to grow...and in fact degrowth is necessary in order to save the planet...and all of the resources are spread thin...it will collapse into fascism and war in order to survive. Capitalism is a very resilient beast. But it is running out of that which makes it resilient. It is in crisis. Where fascism lives.

We haven't solved these banking issues for years since 2008. We haven't fixed any of it, despite what they say. Crisis is built into the system. Every seven years or so we have a crisis that, because of how the system is built, eats the poor in order to sustain the lifestyles of the rich. It eats its own in order to survive. We need to be done with this.

Capitalism won't cure climate change, because there is no profit. Capitalism won't save the planet, because it needs to eat. Capitalism is going to end. Badly. Worse than the feudal-capitalism change. And it is going to eat us until there is no one left.

We need a new system. Capitalism served it's purpose. To get us to a place where automation can improve our lives. Where we could take care of one another. It was good for what it's purpose was. Development and growth and industry. But that time is over...because the planet is making it clear to us. But everyone loves to suck capitalism's dick and will keep us forced into this hellhole with boots on our necks, so that the rich can have their fine caviar.

it’s just a streamlined version of the already established discount window process, minus the additional haircut applied to collateral pledge. the difference is the loan lasts a year rather than the average overnight-90 day loans offered at the discount window. the rate applied to BFTP loans is a one year fixed swap + 10 bps, but given the extended maturity of the loan the rate is comparable to the average primary credit rate over the next year. 

furthermore, the loans taken out of the btfp program are subject to recourse,  so if the bank defaults on their loan or their collateral can’t cover it, the fed and treasury can go after the banks assets. the program isn’t anywhere close to the 2008 bailout, and it’s still holding banks responsible for ensuring their own safety and soundness.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcya8an/,understated_hatpin,25,1679321699.0,2023-03-20 14:14:59,t1_jcy6egp,False,inherited

jcz9lat,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,Why wouldn’t you purchase the house now and just refi when rates go back down? You get to start building equity sooner.  You will have a chance to reduce your interest rate in the future.  Rates matter a lot when you’re doing interest only loans for speculative real estate deals but if it’s a 30 year loan for a home you’ll live in and build a family in wouldn’t it make sense to buy now as home prices have already started to drop?,https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcz9lat/,learning2code101,24,1679336072.0,2023-03-20 18:14:32,t1_jcyx9zm,False,inherited

jcyh0ol,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"Indeed.  And they capitulated.

Furthermore, the previous administration was influential in keeping rates far too low for too long through the 2009-2016 time period.  By 2013/2014, the effects of the GFC had lessened considerably.  Rates should have begun a healthy and measured climb during that time frame as well.  You know, Janet Yellen and her crowd.....

Before THAT, rates were cut to the bone in 2001 as a result of 9/11 and the dot com unravelling, and they held those rates too low all through the 2000's, until they hiked in 2006, which set off the bomb of all bombs that dropped us into the GFC.

So, you see, this goes beyond political party or any one politician.

jcz95oh,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"Indeed, we haven't seen inflation ""break"" yet back to normal levels (2-3%). That's why the Fed is still raising rates to slow the economy by hurting demand for goods and services. Note that the goal isn't to *reduce prices*, it's just to get the rate of price increases back to only 2-3% per year.

The tricky part is that Fed policy doesn't *immediately* impact prices. The impact is long and variable. That makes it a bit of a guessing game as to what the right level of interest rates are. Inflation is still high now, but if the Fed over-reacts, they could send the economy into a depression and we could see prices fall (deflation) which is also undesirable because of the fact that it usually only happens when the economy is collapsing, unemployment is very high, etc. Think 2009.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcz95oh/,Dubs13151,21,1679335904.0,2023-03-20 18:11:44,t1_jcyt9ne,False,inherited
