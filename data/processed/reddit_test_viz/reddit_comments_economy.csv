k3w7sl7,17296na,comment,reddit,economy,"When Oil and Gas has been substantiated by subsidies by every country on Earth, is held in a monopoly and monopsony in OPEC, but they fail in understanding that the Return on Investment for Oil and Gas is below even meaningful numbers, their only point of convention of keeping their cash cow afloat was not making the price rise too much. 

They can control that, they [OPEC+] control the supply, but if you make it so it's too expensive after the subsidies, after the market consolidation, after the intense and already established infrastructure is made and put into work, you can't give your opposition [anti-fossil fuel organizations] the economic incentive to not side with your product. 

*It's to expensive from a short term and long term lens to continue fossil fuels. The EROI average, of fossil fuels are 15:1, when 100 years ago that number was greater than 110:1. The lowest I've seen is Spain, where the EROI is so egregious, that the government itself can't in good faith [invest in it - at 2.4:1](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-leaders-gather-ahead-challenging-cop-28-2023-10-02/)

> example Prieto and Hall, 2012 calculated EROI values that incorporate most energy costs, with the assumption that where ever money was spent energy too was spent. They use data from existing installations in Spain, and derived EROI values of roughly 2.4:1, considerably lower than many less comprehensive estimates.

A general rule is if your investment rate of return is less than inflation, your investment isn't worth it. r>g and all that 

Side note: Just decided to see what Spain has been doing since that report came out [They're fazing out oil and gas subsidies, came out 4 days ago](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-leaders-gather-ahead-challenging-cop-28-2023-10-02/)

OPEC you tried your hand, governments are finding out its more *economically* imperative to get off of fossil fuels.

k3vcf0l,17296na,comment,reddit,economy,"Nope - beyond the seasonality, small increases in price can cause disproportionate response in demand.

Just think about what you mentioned - do you think the average American would agree with the statement that 'national average prices didn't go up that much'?  I do - but I think most would say gasoline is overpriced and constantly going higher.  Perception is reality, and that will cause them to back off.
