1. Its voluntary, except saudi arabia no one needs to go with the cut, they just promised they will. So you might get cut but also not really. Like Angola, which said that they will just not adhere to it. Additionally some countries said they will only cut it for a month 

2.  Its just desperation because USA, Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana increasing production faster than OPEC can lower theirs.

jesmjo8,12a8hh2,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Lithium is inside Seawater, and we are already scrapping the point where it becomes economical to extract it from there. Also, its one of the more common Elements on Earth, so since it became clear it's important, everyone and their Moma has been doing explorations and found large reserves. That ""Lithium scarce"" craze is so wrong, one might believe it could be some Big Oil psyops.

Copper and the Rare Earths are also found, in absurd quantities, in Canada and Australia. The reason most are not mined there (or for copper, only some) is that its hard to compete on price with Congolese Slave Children and subsidized Chinese State mines being allowed to just dump all pollution into the nearest river. Especially for the rare Earths where one single mine alone can satisfy the word demand, so no one is searching for another until other considerations come into play or the monopolists start to demand higher prices. 

Meaning, all those resources have a very low economic price sealing, at which point you just buy Western. For Lithium, another 50% sustained will make seawater distillation viable in most places (currently its only barely profitable, where you're already distilling drinking water, so nobody does that outside of experiments).

jerufol,12a8hh2,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Once upon a time, in the land of Reddit, there was a group of WallStreetBets users who were convinced they were talking to real people. Little did they know, they were actually responding to a horde of bots.

It all started when one user, let's call him Dave, posted a hot tip about a stock he had just invested in. ""Hey guys, I just bought 100 shares of XYZ, it's about to go to the moon!"" he exclaimed. Within seconds, he received a reply from another user, ""Wow, that's great! I just bought in too, let's make some tendies!""

Excited to have found a fellow investor, Dave responded with even more enthusiasm, ""Hell yeah, let's do this! To the moon!"" And so began a long thread of back-and-forth messages between Dave and this ""fellow investor.""

However, as the conversation continued, something seemed off. The other user's responses were always perfectly timed and often repeated the same phrases. And then it hit Dave - this was not a real person, it was a bot!

Feeling embarrassed, Dave scrolled through the rest of the thread and realized that every single user who had replied to his original post was a bot. They all had similar usernames and profile pictures, and their responses were eerily similar.

But it didn't end there. As Dave dug deeper, he discovered that the bots had been manipulating the stock market by artificially inflating the hype around certain stocks. And to make matters worse, they were all run by the same person - a tech-savvy investor who had created the bots to make a quick buck.

Dave couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. He had been duped by a horde of bots, and he wasn't alone. The entire WallStreetBets community had fallen for the same trick. But in the end, they all learned a valuable lesson - never trust a stranger on the internet, especially if they're a bot.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12a8hh2/opec_announces_production_cuts/jerufol/,JPOWsToolkit,5,1680520781.0,2023-04-03 11:19:41,t1_jerq7ej,False,inherited

jy0x2am,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"So the aim of the ETF is to track the current oil price.  To mimic this, the ETF invests in oil futures contracts, generally short dated ones. Previously, it needed to spread out the exposure across a bunch of different expiration dates, meaning the ""price"" it tracked was a weighted average over the next few months. Now it'll be mostly the next month's futures contract.  


If you want to YOLO on this, feel free to buy the ETF.  Right now oil prices are in backwardation, which means you'll capture some roll yield.  (Explained simply, since next month's futures contract is trading below the front month, when you ""roll"" the exposure (sell the front month to buy the next month) you capture a the spread.).

jy1php2,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"USO keeps their positions in physical futures.  A futures contract with physical deliver has a last traded date and a delivery date.

Let's say they have a bunch of futures whose last traded date is 9/1.  They only hold futures for exposure to oil, and don't actually want to take delivery of oil, so by settlement on 9/1 they need to sell those contracts and buy contracts with a last traded date in the future.

This is called ""rolling"" contracts and with as big of a position as USO carries, is a big deal.  If you remember when oil went negative -- it's because USO's rules forced them to roll a significant position on the last trading day and there was such a glut of physical oil that noone had the physical space to take delivery.  So the negative price was literally them paying people to take the contracts off their hands who had some way to take delivery despite there being no excess physical storage space.

After that debacle they changed the rules on how they can roll, and what expirations they will keep their positions in.  The linked article appears to be a change to those rules which likely will track futures prices better by letting them keep more of their money in contracts with a closer last trade date, but also might open them up to similar tail risks in the future.

How you take advantage of this?  Hard to say without any research.  But there are legions of quants and professional traders whose bread and butter is studying futures rolls so someone out there is playing close attention.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1634cxq/biggest_us_oil_etf_to_shift_holdings_to_front_of/jy1php2/,Chuu,17,1693194160.0,2023-08-28 03:42:40,t1_jy10o8z,False,inherited

This has no impact on the price of the ETF. It will just own more of the October contract. That’s the content of my statement “you don’t get an immediate increase in price from this roll.”

Now, if the October contract evolves to $2 the ETF price will increase. That’s were you get your gain.

Do we agree on this?

jyd79lo,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"I think we are not saying the same thing… the PnL of USO is 1$ in your example and it cannot be reinvested, lest you become a leveraged fund (each share would now represent 2x the lots, 4x at the next roll and so on). The PnL eventually either gets distributed or it just increases the ETF shares, which going forward may start having a life on their own then, disconnected from WTI, but I digress…

The fact that the flat price traces back any pre-roll of M-1, is a bit irrelevant. The PnL from the roll is already made and won’t go away. You can find it on the PnL, the BS is not per se useful at this stage. The next thing that happens (flat price moving either way) will just be a normal trading PnL and will move the bottom line regardless of what happened earlier.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1634cxq/biggest_us_oil_etf_to_shift_holdings_to_front_of/jyd79lo/,chrisBlo,1,1693398873.0,2023-08-30 12:34:33,t1_jyaiqq2,False,inherited
jydcdka,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the discussion… so the difference is how the PnL of $1 per contract is distributed: buying a larger number of contracts of the next month if in backwardation (what I thought happened), distributing cash to shareholders (don’t think that happens), creating more shares, etc. You are saying they create more shares or just hold it in cash, is that correct?

I don’t see how buying more contracts turns it into a leveraged fund. They hold more contracts, but the fund NAV still tracks the price movement of the contract being held (modulo any tracking errors). I know UNG/BOIL better than USO so I’ll use them as an example. As of 6/30 they held about 27,000 Aug23 contracts. As of 8/29 they had about 30,000 Oct23 contracts. Clearly they increased the number of contracts without becoming a leveraged fund.

Not trying to argue, trying to understand… I couldn’t find out how this works precisely from the latest 10Q.

jyeosig,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Likewise!

A part of it stays in cash, but very marginal, that’s true. Buying more contracts puts operational leverage, as your single share of ETF would now be tracking 2 lots instead of one. Still linear, but 2x. And at the next roll it would double again… the easiest way to manage the extra profits is to adjust your shares.

I don’t known BOIL that much sorry, but you should check if they had any NNM over the same period, because the fact that they increased the lots may just be a natural expansion then.

jilky0s,135r75n,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"A good chunk of my portfolio is in Oil and Gas (XOM,TTE, EQNR). 

I'm not betting on production cuts. I'm betting on the premature mandates on the energy transition. Which will force LNG to play a massive role. Especially since people are shunning Nuclear. Then oil via gas normal demand to skyrocket prices because the world said no to increases.  Along with the companies themselves not justifying further expansion in production. 

Gas prices have swung wildly this last year. This past week in my area it was almost back to it's highs.

And no I'm expecting this in the next year but over the next 5-10",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/135r75n/dont_get_fooled_by_the_oil_narratives_remember/jilky0s/,JustNotFatal,2,1683054164.0,2023-05-02 19:02:44,t3_135r75n,False,inherited
