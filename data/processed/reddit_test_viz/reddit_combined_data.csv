jepn69l,129pcf4,comment,reddit,stocks,"Biden & his administration have been trying to drive oil prices down by releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, pressuring other countries to produce more, approving more oil fields to open. 

The problem is that prices are climbing because of increasing and historic levels of energy demand. There is no emphasis on restraint of energy consumption, or consumption of any type. 

In this situation, the only restraint on energy consumption IS high prices. This is why environmentalists have been trying to shut down oil fields and restrict production all these years. High energy prices are the cure for excessive energy demand.

By increasing production and suppressing oil & gas prices, Biden is engaging in straight up climate change denier policy, and promoting more energy consumption.

> I guarantee you 100% you people would be blaming him for higher prices if he didn't do what he did.

Of course they would. Because online communities are only for climate change mitigation when it consists of promoting Tesla & EVs and other cool technology.

kbvdt78,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,"> Oil producers outside OPEC+ are pumping oil at record levels and can now cover global demand, which which has forced the Saudi-led alliance to cut to keep the market balanced in their favor, according to Kaneva. 

The two-part problem for the OPEC+ cartel is going to be difficult for them to navigate:

* Member nations need a certain level of oil revenue/profits to balance their own national budgets. Russia is close to trying to fund a total war off of oil revenue, and Nigeria/Angola can't afford to hold back production. Saudi Arabia can voluntarily cut revenue enough to keep prices high, but then they don't get the benefit of high prices when they're not selling enough volume. All the other OPEC and OPEC+ countries need that combination of price and volume to balance their budgets, so they're all hoping that other nations' voluntary cuts support the prices necessary, without having to sacrifice their own volume.
* Producers in non-member nations (and member nations that don't obey the quotas) can free-ride off of OPEC+'s price manipulation to get high volume at high prices. The United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Brazil, Norway, and Kazakhstan are producing a bunch of oil, and its producers love when the Saudis push prices up. (And even though Brazil and Kazakhstan are sometimes geopolitically aligned with OPEC+, that's offset by the fact that OPEC member nation Iraq ignores quotas).

As long as non-OPEC+ production capacity remains high, the OPEC+ nations can't effectively manipulate prices, which will cause dissent within its own ranks.",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18a09bh/saudi_arabia_is_struggling_to_boost_oil_prices/kbvdt78/,Already-Price-Tin,68,1701640733.0,2023-12-03 21:58:53,t3_18a09bh,False,inherited,,,,,

In fact the royal families are so deeply entrenched into the country that removing the royal family would destroy the country in the process. Any family that is at risk will have the US come and support it.

Also, and i say this because I used to consult with a B4 in MENA, theres absolutely no way those countries are falling without bringing down the entire world with them. PIF / Mubadala basically funded Silicon Valley and have controlling ownership stakes inultiple large companies across the world. Hell the largest refinery on the US is Saudi owned via Aramco. DP world, UAE GRE, has a controlling share in many important western and eastern ports. These are only a slice of control the GCC have.

Also, Iran's power is limited due to how important of a strategic ally the GCC is for the US / NATO / Europe. There's alot of anti-GCC stuff on reddit but it'd be foolish to think that the GCC does not have a chokehold on the global economy and the world will protect the GCC to maintain status quo. There's a reason that the US has the largest military base in ME in Qatar. It has alot to do with how important the GCC is to maintain economic stability. E.g. Should the GCC depeg its currency from the USD, the consequences will be disastrous.

129pcf4,,post,reddit,stocks,"DUBAI, April 2 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers on Sunday announced voluntary cuts to their production amounting to around 1.15 million barrels per day in a surprise move they said was aimed at supporting market stability.

The group had been largely expected to stick to its already agreed 2 million bpd cuts when its ministerial panel, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, meets virtually on Monday.

Last October, OPEC+, which comprises the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, agreed output cuts of 2 million bpd from November until the end of the year, angering Washington as tighter supply boosts oil prices.

The U.S. has argued that the world needs lower prices to support economic growth and prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from earning more revenue to fund the Ukraine war.

Sunday's unexpected voluntary cuts, which start from May, come in addition to the ones already agreed in October.

Riyadh said it would cut output by 500,000 bpd while Iraq will reduce its production by 211,000 bpd, according to official statements.

The UAE said it would cut production by 144,000 bpd, Kuwait announced a cut of 128,000 bpd while Oman announced a cut of 40,000 bpd and Algeria said it would cut its output by 48,000 bpd. Kazakhstan will also cut output by 78,000 bpd.

Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak also said on Sunday that Moscow would extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023. Moscow announced those cuts unilaterally in February following the introduction of Western price caps.

After Russia's unilateral reductions, U.S. officials said its alliance with other OPEC members was weakening, but Sunday's move shows the cooperation is still strong.

The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement that the kingdom's voluntary cut was a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.

Oil prices fell to 15-month lows earlier this month in response to the banking crisis that followed the collapse of two U.S. lenders and resulted in Credit Suisse being rescued by Switzerland's biggest bank UBS.

18a09bh,,post,reddit,stocks,"OPEC is facing growing challenges in its efforts to boost oil prices amid record output outside the alliance, particularly in the U.S., raising questions about how long the alliance can maintain its deep production cuts. OPEC and its allies, OPEC+, failed to reach a unanimous agreement Thursday on cuts, even after delaying the meeting by five days in an effort to shore up unity within the alliance. Instead, seven members announced voluntary, unilateral cuts to the tune of 2.2 million barrels per day for the first quarter of 2024. 

The outcome is a “bittersweet victory” for OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, wrote Jorge Leon, senior vice president of Rystad Energy, in a note Thursday. Riyadh convinced members to share some of the burden in cutting. But the failure to secure a formal agreement “does not bode well for the group’s unity and cohesion and limits the group’s ability to balance the market,” Leon wrote. 

With oil prices down more than 14% since September highs, traders were hoping that OPEC could provide a boost. So far, however, the cuts are not having the intended effect on oil prices. U.S. crude fell more than 2% Thursday, while Brent dropped 0.3%. Oil futures were down more than 2% on Friday. Traders are disappointed that the cuts are short term, just one quarter, and worried that OPEC+ will not be able to hold itself together, Leon wrote in a note Thursday. 

OPEC+ is increasingly struggling to coordinate large reductions given the size of cuts already in place and the limited impact they are having on prices, JPMorgan analyst Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note Friday. In the end, Saudi Arabia may have only one option — launch a supply war by flooding the market with oil. “They could just add two and a half million barrels into the market for six months and just flush it,” Paul Sankey, a top oil market analyst and president at Sankey Research, said on CNBC’s ” Fast Money ” Thursday. 

Oil below $60 on supply war? The Saudis face two problems — restlessness within the OPEC+ ranks on the cuts and record production outside the alliance, particularly in the U.S. Oil producers outside OPEC+ are pumping oil at record levels and can now cover global demand, which which has forced the Saudi-led alliance to cut to keep the market balanced in their favor, according to Kaneva. John Kilduff, founder of Again Capital, thinks the Saudis are fighting a losing battle with the U.S. Riyadh is currently producing 9 million bpd compared to 13 million bpd in the U.S. And record production outside OPEC comes at a time when demand growth is faltering in China, Kilduff said. “They have a big problem on their hands,” Kilduff said of Saudi Arabia. “They have their hands full and to me it’s not going to prove to be a winning strategy for them,” he said of the output cuts. 

Sankey said the Saudis would need to dramatically slash prices to keep production from growing in the U.S and regain market share. This would require pushing crude below $60 per barrel because that is the price U.S. producers are planning for right now, Sankey said. The Saudis already came close to “burning the house down” this week as they struggled to get OPEC+ members in line, Kilduff said. Given the challenges facing OPEC+, the group’s exit strategy from the current cuts is now in sharp focus, Kaneva wrote in a November note. If Saudi Arabia and Russia return 1.3 million bpd to the market in April, the price of Brent would average $77 per barrel in 2024 and $57 per barrel in 2025, according to Kaneva. This would trigger a slowdown in drilling and fracking activity in the second half of 2024, shaving off about 170,000 bpd of U.S. production growth, she wrote.  In 2025, U.S. liquids production would be flat compared to JPMorgan’s baseline of 740,000 bpd of growth. 

Compliance under scrutiny. For now, the focus is on whether OPEC+ will actually come through with the cuts promised Thursday. The 2.2 million bpd in voluntary cuts from the coalition of the willing is somewhat deceiving. Saudi Arabia, for example, simply rolled over its current 1 million bpd cut, while Russia increased its export curbs – not production – by 200,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd total. In reality, the new cuts to production for the first quarter total about 700,000 bpd total from Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman. 

Goldman Sachs, for its part, declined to change its oil price forecast on the OPEC decision as the investment bank waits for “clarity on compliance with cuts and additional inventories data.” Goldman still expects OPEC to keep Brent in a range of $80 to $100 a barrel in 2024. But compliance with voluntary cuts is a “stress test” of whether Brent will maintain an $80 floor, analyst Daan Struyven wrote. A slowdown in U.S. supply growth in 2024 is another major assumption supporting that price floor. One downside risk to the $80 floor would be persistent upside surprises in crude inventories particularly in the U.S., according to Goldman. Global inventories rose by 300,000 bpd on average in October and November, while Goldman had forecast a decline of 700,000 bpd. And then there is the problem of OPEC unity — or lack thereof. “The further rise in spare capacity and the voluntary nature of today’s cut imply that additional large OPEC+ cuts in response to any additional inventory beats become increasingly difficult to implement,” Struyven wrote.

jesmjo8,12a8hh2,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Lithium is inside Seawater, and we are already scrapping the point where it becomes economical to extract it from there. Also, its one of the more common Elements on Earth, so since it became clear it's important, everyone and their Moma has been doing explorations and found large reserves. That ""Lithium scarce"" craze is so wrong, one might believe it could be some Big Oil psyops.

Copper and the Rare Earths are also found, in absurd quantities, in Canada and Australia. The reason most are not mined there (or for copper, only some) is that its hard to compete on price with Congolese Slave Children and subsidized Chinese State mines being allowed to just dump all pollution into the nearest river. Especially for the rare Earths where one single mine alone can satisfy the word demand, so no one is searching for another until other considerations come into play or the monopolists start to demand higher prices. 

Meaning, all those resources have a very low economic price sealing, at which point you just buy Western. For Lithium, another 50% sustained will make seawater distillation viable in most places (currently its only barely profitable, where you're already distilling drinking water, so nobody does that outside of experiments).

jerufol,12a8hh2,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Once upon a time, in the land of Reddit, there was a group of WallStreetBets users who were convinced they were talking to real people. Little did they know, they were actually responding to a horde of bots.

It all started when one user, let's call him Dave, posted a hot tip about a stock he had just invested in. ""Hey guys, I just bought 100 shares of XYZ, it's about to go to the moon!"" he exclaimed. Within seconds, he received a reply from another user, ""Wow, that's great! I just bought in too, let's make some tendies!""

Excited to have found a fellow investor, Dave responded with even more enthusiasm, ""Hell yeah, let's do this! To the moon!"" And so began a long thread of back-and-forth messages between Dave and this ""fellow investor.""

However, as the conversation continued, something seemed off. The other user's responses were always perfectly timed and often repeated the same phrases. And then it hit Dave - this was not a real person, it was a bot!

Feeling embarrassed, Dave scrolled through the rest of the thread and realized that every single user who had replied to his original post was a bot. They all had similar usernames and profile pictures, and their responses were eerily similar.

But it didn't end there. As Dave dug deeper, he discovered that the bots had been manipulating the stock market by artificially inflating the hype around certain stocks. And to make matters worse, they were all run by the same person - a tech-savvy investor who had created the bots to make a quick buck.

Dave couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. He had been duped by a horde of bots, and he wasn't alone. The entire WallStreetBets community had fallen for the same trick.

jy0x2am,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"So the aim of the ETF is to track the current oil price.  To mimic this, the ETF invests in oil futures contracts, generally short dated ones. Previously, it needed to spread out the exposure across a bunch of different expiration dates, meaning the ""price"" it tracked was a weighted average over the next few months. Now it'll be mostly the next month's futures contract.  


If you want to YOLO on this, feel free to buy the ETF.  Right now oil prices are in backwardation, which means you'll capture some roll yield.  (Explained simply, since next month's futures contract is trading below the front month, when you ""roll"" the exposure (sell the front month to buy the next month) you capture a the spread.).

jy1php2,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"USO keeps their positions in physical futures.  A futures contract with physical deliver has a last traded date and a delivery date.

Let's say they have a bunch of futures whose last traded date is 9/1.  They only hold futures for exposure to oil, and don't actually want to take delivery of oil, so by settlement on 9/1 they need to sell those contracts and buy contracts with a last traded date in the future.

This is called ""rolling"" contracts and with as big of a position as USO carries, is a big deal.  If you remember when oil went negative -- it's because USO's rules forced them to roll a significant position on the last trading day and there was such a glut of physical oil that noone had the physical space to take delivery.  So the negative price was literally them paying people to take the contracts off their hands who had some way to take delivery despite there being no excess physical storage space.

After that debacle they changed the rules on how they can roll, and what expirations they will keep their positions in.  The linked article appears to be a change to those rules which likely will track futures prices better by letting them keep more of their money in contracts with a closer last trade date, but also might open them up to similar tail risks in the future.

How you take advantage of this?  Hard to say without any research.  But there are legions of quants and professional traders whose bread and butter is studying futures rolls so someone out there is playing close attention.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1634cxq/biggest_us_oil_etf_to_shift_holdings_to_front_of/jy1php2/,Chuu,17,1693194160.0,2023-08-28 03:42:40,t1_jy10o8z,False,inherited,,,,,

jyd79lo,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"I think we are not saying the same thing… the PnL of USO is 1$ in your example and it cannot be reinvested, lest you become a leveraged fund (each share would now represent 2x the lots, 4x at the next roll and so on).

The fact that the flat price traces back any pre-roll of M-1, is a bit irrelevant. The PnL from the roll is already made and won’t go away. You can find it on the PnL, the BS is not per se useful at this stage.

jydcdka,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the discussion… so the difference is how the PnL of $1 per contract is distributed: buying a larger number of contracts of the next month if in backwardation (what I thought happened), distributing cash to shareholders (don’t think that happens), creating more shares, etc. You are saying they create more shares or just hold it in cash, is that correct?

I don’t see how buying more contracts turns it into a leveraged fund. They hold more contracts, but the fund NAV still tracks the price movement of the contract being held (modulo any tracking errors). I know UNG/BOIL better than USO so I’ll use them as an example. As of 6/30 they held about 27,000 Aug23 contracts. As of 8/29 they had about 30,000 Oct23 contracts. Clearly they increased the number of contracts without becoming a leveraged fund.

jyeosig,1634cxq,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Likewise!

A part of it stays in cash, but very marginal, that’s true. Buying more contracts puts operational leverage, as your single share of ETF would now be tracking 2 lots instead of one. Still linear, but 2x. And at the next roll it would double again… the easiest way to manage the extra profits is to adjust your shares.

I don’t known BOIL that much sorry, but you should check if they had any NNM over the same period, because the fact that they increased the lots may just be a natural expansion then.

In a dramatic and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers have announced a series of cuts. This powerful alliance includes heavyweight oil producers like Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, and Algeria.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has pledged to reduce its oil output by a massive 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May until the end of 2023, in a move described by the Saudi energy ministry as a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market"". Joining the colossal effort, Russia's deputy prime minister declared that Moscow would also extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023.

Other key players in the OPEC+ alliance have stepped up with their own production cuts. The United Arab Emirates plans to cut 144,000 bpd, Kuwait with 128,000 bpd, Iraq by 211,000 bpd, Oman with 40,000 bpd, and Algeria to reduce output by 48,000 bpd. Collectively, these substantial reductions demonstrate the alliance's dedication to fostering a stable and balanced oil market.

【How to Respond to Russia's Oil Production Cut】

Earlier we discussed OPEC and individual oil-producing countries' lack of willingness to increase production, and even their desire to reduce production. After all, increasing production means further suppressing oil prices, while reducing production means indicating weak demand. Therefore, the joint production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia to some extent demonstrates uncertainty in demand growth and concerns about economic recession.

Compared with the potential inflation caused by reducing production, oil, as the lifeblood of industry, affects people's daily lives worldwide. Investors should be more concerned about the impact of this OPEC production cut on economic activity. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is equivalent to a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which will also suppress economic activity. Economic recession means limited room for oil price increases. Therefore, long positions in crude oil should be cautious, constantly monitoring whether oil prices break below support levels, and paying attention to shifts in the long-short style.

However, for US oil stocks, it's a win-win situation. The production cost of US shale oil is between $40-50 per barrel. US oil companies can both legitimately increase production and sell at a good price, and act as a vanguard during economic recovery. In this situation, oil stocks' buyback performance and dividend payouts are good.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12fhlry/next_weeks_trading_410414_how_to_deal_with_oil/,MontedCristo,11,1680948699.0,2023-04-08 10:11:39,,,high,Next week's trading (4.10-4.14) + how to deal with oil production cuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12fhlry/next_weeks_trading_410414_how_to_deal_with_oil/,16.0,True,0.9615805604203154
14kihdk,,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,"For those who have followed me, you may remember my post last year warning people not to go too bullish on OPEC's cuts. I explained why they were smoke and mirror. Why you shouldn't expect any return to $122 prices. And why oil prices were actually more likely to go down. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w25s6z/oil\_had\_a\_great\_run\_but\_it\_may\_be\_time\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w25s6z/oil_had_a_great_run_but_it_may_be_time_to/)

And again with the more recent cuts. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people\_betting\_on\_oil\_stocks\_now\_because\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people_betting_on_oil_stocks_now_because_of_the/)

Now oil prices have slipped under $70.

Why have oil prices gone down for a year, when demand is supposed to have picked up with the supply chain and cruises back up, people flying and traveling again, China ending its lockdowns, the energy crisis, sanctions on Russia, and OPEC cutting its outputs?

It's a much more complex picture than that.

You have to look at all the factors at play, the context, the timing, and what's really happening. 

In the first post I explained a lot of the underlying factors that bullish people might have overlooked. 

You have to look at not just what the OPEC output targets are, but what the countries are actually producing. And everything in between from the supply chain to the refineries. 

If people who had called $100+ had looked at those, they would have instead had more expectations below $90. 

# But let's look at the present situation.

There's a ton of factors, and I recommend doing your own research and looking at each one yourself. It's a complex picture, with many moving parts. 

But one of the factors worth mentioning is Russia having to desperately unload its oil for cheap and flooding the market. On top of the gap between output and target cuts, this has also negated any of the few OPEC countries that had any real changes in output.

However, after a year of being bearish on oil prices, I'm no longer as bearish as I once was.

But I'm not bullish yet, just a little less bearish. I just think the downtrend will slow and stabilize. 

...barring any recession, housing market crash, wild OPEC shift, that could re-accelerate the downtrend. 

And that's a big if. Since I'm not feeling positive about the housing market right now, and can really see a correction. That could potentially affect the market demand. 

Plus we are currently in the prime season for oil demand. We'll be heading into the weaker months at the end of the year. 

I can see the downtrend slowing and stabilizing at best. But I'm still not seeing a big come back, or oil prices back above $100 this year.

Maybe next year oil bulls. 

# The stock side

We could however see more positives for the stock side in the energy industry.

This is where I might be even less bearish, and slightly becoming bullish. 

Looking beyond just the commodity side itself, the industry related stocks have actually not been doing that bad, all things considered. XOM, CVX, and Shell, have had somewhat of a stable trend to a mild downward trend for the past year. Smaller stock in things like oil exploration, shale industry, etc... have been a little more volatile. 

If you believe the current stock market rally is part of a long term trend for a next bull cycle, and not a bull trap, then the oil industry related stocks might be worth looking into. There is a potential for a much more positive oil market next year, and maybe more stability as early as this year. 

You also have to believe that there is no further threat of recession or some housing market crash.

And you have to believe that we're not quiet there yet with renewable energy, with electric cars, and that China, India, and Brazil will outpace that with high demand for a lot of fossil fuel vehicles.

13zgpuc,,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,"OPEC+ is striving to sustain oil prices while avoiding disputes. Interestingly, as soon as the group stopped holding monthly meetings, prices immediately spiraled out of control.

Indeed, there's no one to blame here, as circumstances beyond the member’s’ contract have unfolded unfavorably. But it's still quite amusing.

Just two months ago, they had to hastily cut production without holding any meeting. The move was dramatic, but short-lived.

So, why not try it again?

Last week, Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman [cautioned short-sellers against betting on a decline](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13qkuaj/i_keep_warning_them_that_they_will_be_hurting/), hinting at potential action. But it's not as simple as it seems.

Real production cuts only began in May, and the impact has not yet been felt. Bloomberg calculated that OPEC's production has fallen by only 0.5 million bpd relative to April, and by 1 million bpd relative to February.

This is less than the 1.2 million bpd announced in April (formally it was 2 million, but part of it was simply a shortfall of quotas). Even so, disregarding the slump during the pandemic, OPEC's production is at its lowest level since the crisis year of 2009.

As early as last fall, not everyone considered cuts to be a good idea. The UAE was unhappy that they were not able to utilize their recently upgraded production capabilities. At the moment, 30% of UAE capacity is sitting idle, a figure even larger than Iran’s.

There are also questions among OPEC+ members regarding the pace of cuts, and the discussion at the meeting promises to be heated.

Raising prices would be beneficial. But announcing a reduction that will not be implemented is risky. It could undermine the group’s credibility and influence. And the further the ordered cuts go, the harder it will be to achieve agreement and discipline within the cartel.

I suspect that if another cut is necessary, an agreement will be reached. But it's unlikely to happen tomorrow. The situation just isn’t tat dire—at least, it isn’t yet. Prices have been rising for two days, short-sellers are reducing their risks just in case, and overall market optimism has increased.

I expect that tomorrow OPEC will limit itself to verbal interventions. **WTI prices will not stray far from $70 and will return to that level within one to two weeks.** Volatility will decrease.

If production is indeed cut, we might see a jump to $80, but this would look like an all-in from OPEC. They would have to hope for a recovery in Chinese demand. Otherwise, a deeper fall is inevitable, and there won't be tools to contain it​.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13zgpuc/opecs_challenge_sustaining_oil_prices_while/,bitkogan,17,1685807202.0,2023-06-03 15:46:42,,,high,OPEC+'s Challenge: Sustaining Oil Prices While Avoiding Disputes,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13zgpuc/opecs_challenge_sustaining_oil_prices_while/,12.0,True,1.0

Oil price at the time of that post : $91.

&#x200B;

**Why did the price go down when OPEC made production cuts?**

It was in essence a quota cut not a production cut.

They were already more than a couple of million barrels a day behind their existing quota. Thanks to many OPEC countries being behind. Countries like Libya that had geopolitical problems that shut down nearly their entire oil production. Problems that were resolved at the time of the cut when rebels lifted their blockades. There were a lot more supply and demand shifts. From China, to supply chain, etc...

All this meant that oil output actually increased, despite the ""cuts"" officially declared on paper.

&#x200B;

**This isn't coming from hindsight 20/20.**

I explained this 7 months ago: [https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people\_betting\_on\_oil\_stocks\_now\_because\_of\_the/](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people_betting_on_oil_stocks_now_because_of_the/)

Price of oil at the time of my post: $88.

**OPEC has recently declared more cuts, and yet we're seeing prices drop to $72..**

**If unsure about oil, follow inverse Cramer:**

Oil is fickle and has many moving parts that you have to keep an eye on. And at the end of the day, it's a cartel, with many geopolitical elements that can ignite surprises.

Maybe next month oil will finally go sky high past $100.

But what's still reliable is inverse Cramer. Keep on eye out on what he says about oil.

12adqvv,,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Just as investors putting the banking crisis behind, OPEC+'s surprise decision to cut production reignited fears of sustained inflation and a potentially prolonged rate hike cycle of central banks.

Strategists believe stocks are likely to drop as higher oil prices from the production cut crimp growth. However, they said the market may struggle to price in expectations of further Fed rate hikes.

US dollar rose against all major currencies except the currencies of oil suppliers Norway and Canada, reflecting market bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates further.

Traders expect the Fed to have about a 60% chance of another rate hike at its May policy meeting, up from 56% on Friday. They expect the Fed to cut borrowing costs by the end of the year, the data showed.

“The OPEC+ production cut is another reminder that the inflation genie is not back in the bottle,” said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard Ltd. in New York. He believes this move increases the risk of more persistent inflation, and “it also likely limits the latitude central banks might have to relax monetary policy even if the economy slows.”

“For equity investors, this could be a rude awakening, as markets imply a Goldilocks outlook of reduced discount rates but no recession. Bond markets have been more sober in assessing recession risk, but perhaps too optimistic in terms of the likely central bank response to weakening growth. Today’s decision makes the outlook more complex for investors across the board.”

Fed Dilemma

“Since inflation is likely to remain the biggest driver of the Fed’s monetary policy, the market will be less likely to assume an early shift to lower rates or a faster pace of rate cuts,” said Hidehiro Joke, a strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “However, the OPEC+ production cut report alone is unlikely to foster expectations of a prolonged rate hike, as was the case prior to the recent financial turmoil. Therefore, it will be difficult for the market to aggressively price in an additional rate hikes by the Fed.”

Growth Drag

“Stocks will trade lower today,” said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG Australia. “Coming on top of the fallout of the banking crisis which is expected to lead to tighter credit and slower growth, higher energy prices will also weigh on growth and likely to take some of the steam out of last weeks rebound in equity markets.”

Oil Bulls

The production cuts are bullish for oil and “will help to drive Brent faster back to $100 per barrel as global jet fuel demand revives,” Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AG. “It’s easy to cut when there is limited risk for loss of market share to US shale oil as growth there slows. More market power to OPEC+ and higher oil prices is the natural consequence of fading US shale oil growth.”

16uqyi0,,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,"Almost no one but me appears to doubt that, if major suppliers (read: the Saudis) do in fact persist with their supply cuts, oil will surpass $100 again.

From the Saudi perspective, the math is simple. Why sell 7 million barrels a day (their exports from a year ago) at $70 when you can offload 5.5 million (exports in August) for $100 or more?

Saudi logic stands clear, and their short-term supply shock strategy seems to be working flawlessly.

But what lies ahead?

Demand is dwindling, while at the same time, supply outside the cartel keeps expanding. For the past three weeks, US production has consistently hovered around 12.9 million barrels per day—a spike of 640,000 barrels over the average during the first half of the year.

Consequently, to sustain these prices, Saudi Arabia might need to enforce even more drastic production cuts. This will reduce both their revenue and their market influence.

Political risks loom large too. The cartel's gains are essentially deductions from the consumer's wallet. Almost no one is thrilled with the present dynamic, and it might even be bad enough to inspire the creation of NOPEC.

In a nutshell, I'm skeptical about long-term price ascension. That’s precisely why the recent price correction in oil, juxtaposed against rising stock levels, doesn't astonish me. Oddly enough, for October, I'd rather see prices gravitating towards $100. It would ensure my bearish hedge operates at its peak efficiency.

*Saudi Arabia led the cartel by pledging its own 500,000 barrel-a-day supply reduction. Fellow members including Kuwait, the United Arabia Emirates and Algeria followed suit, while Russia said the production cut it was implementing from March to June would continue until the end of the 2023.*
*That means, starting in May, there will be about 1 million barrels a day less crude flowing into the market than previously expected.*

Remember every BEV removes 10 barrels per year. Which is not much. But last year 1 in 14 new US vehicles was BEV. Higher in Europe and coming on strong in China. 

So now that millions of new cars are BEVs and the older less efficient ICE vehicles are coming off line and the largest group of people in world history is retiring (world wide baby boomers this decade) which lowers total miles per year per vehicle. So putting them all together we are seeing a small but rising trend of oil use reduction. 

How fast is anyone's guess but it's happening and more and more it will slow new investments and reduce the grip of oil on the world economy. 

Normally I don't buy into this stuff. But when I see the majors investing in renewables and selling off or writing down harder to reach oil reserves I suspect they know something.

**Saudi Arabia prepares to prolong reductions into spring after price hits four-month low of $77**

Saudi Arabia is preparing to prolong oil production cuts into next year as Opec+ weighs further reductions in response to falling prices and rising anger over the Israel-Hamas war.

After prices hit a four-month low of $77 a barrel this week, four people familiar with the Saudi government’s thinking said it was highly likely to extend its 1mn barrel-a-day cut at least until the spring.

The voluntary measure, due to expire at the end of this year, was introduced in the summer as a temporary step on top of wider cuts by the oil cartel. At present, Saudi Arabia produces about 9mn b/d, compared with a maximum of about 12mn b/d.

Further cuts, which could inflame tensions with the US, are under discussion by Opec+ as it prepares to meet in Vienna on November 26.

While the oil price drop is the main cause, members are also indignant at Israel’s war on Hamas and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

An additional Opec+ cut of up to 1mn b/d could be on the table, one informed person said, describing the cartel as “galvanised” by the conflict.

Kuwait, Algeria and Iran are among the Opec members most agitated by the conflict.

“You should not underestimate the level of anger there is and the pressure leaders in the Gulf feel from their populations to be seen to respond in some manner,” said another person close to senior Opec figures in the Gulf.

The person said there would be no repeat of the oil shock of the 1970s, when Arab states halted exports to the west. But they added: “People have become complacent about the potential to tighten oil supplies to send a subtle message, which will be well understood both in the streets and Washington DC.”

k9o9s89,17xmx0i,comment,reddit,Economics,"The people close to Saudi Arabia’s thinking stressed that no final decision had yet been made. They emphasised that any public statements by Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, would keep the focus on the oil market, rather than the Israel-Hamas war.

Prince Abdulaziz recently hit out at hedge funds that have increased their bets against oil, amid expectations that the market may move into a small surplus next year because of the weak global economy and rising supplies outside Opec.

Christian Malek at JPMorgan said Opec+ could carry out an additional 1mn b/d cut to pre-empt “potential demand weakness” in the first half of next year, with Saudi Arabia looking to other members to “share the load” of any further cuts.

Other analysts suggested that Prince Abdulaziz could push other countries to deepen cuts — or comply with past commitments to reduce production — by threatening that Saudi Arabia could shift back towards full production unless such steps are taken.

Russia, an Opec+ member that depends heavily on oil to finance its invasion of Ukraine, has been increasing seaborne exports in recent months.

The economic reform programme of Prince Abdulaziz’s half-brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman requires an oil price close to $100 a barrel, analysts maintain. The plan ranges from building hypermodern cities to hosting the 2034 football World Cup.

But some experts suggested Opec+ members will proceed cautiously, mindful of their growing role on the international stage. The United Arab Emirates, which hosts the UN COP28 climate talks in Dubai this month, is keen to portray itself as a modernising force.

“This is an incredibly delicate time in the Middle East,” said Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst and head of RBC Capital Markets commodities research.

We’re talking about moving the needle on the massive ships that are country’s foreign policy. Only the exceedingly naive do not realize that takes time measured in months, and often, years.

The Interior Department announced its final drilling plan for offshore oil and gas leasing over the next five years on Friday, setting three further lease sales between 2024 and 2029.  
  
The federal government is required to lease at least 60 million acres for oil and gas exploration as a condition of issuing offshore wind power leases under the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.  
  
In the final plan, the department set a lease sale in the Outer Continental Shelf for 2025, with another to follow in 2027 and a third in 2029.  
  
Industry trade group the American Petroleum Institute (API) criticized the plan as a “step in the wrong direction” in a statement.  
  
“Simply put, this final 5-year program fails to meet the energy needs of the American people and could threaten to increase reliance on foreign energy sources,” Holly Hopkins, API’s vice president of upstream policy, said in a statement.  
  
“Demand for affordable, reliable energy is only growing, yet the administration is choosing to limit future production in a region that plays a critical role in powering our nation and supplies among the lowest carbon-intensive barrels in the world,” Hopkins added.  
  
Environmental groups also took issue with the plan, with the ocean conservation groups hitting the administration for allowing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
“This Five-Year Plan started with President Trump proposing to open nearly all U.S. waters to offshore oil drilling and ends with President Biden’s final plan that is the smallest to date,” Beth Lowell, Oceana’s vice president for the United States, wrote in a statement.  
  
“The footprint of offshore drilling was not expanded, but the dangerous cycle of drilling and spilling must end,” Lowell said.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/18k11j2/biden_administration_issues_final_fiveyear/kdo2s3g/,PuzzledSeating,5,1702761916.0,2023-12-16 21:25:16,t3_18k11j2,True,inherited,,,,,

jcxzigt,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"The Fed sets interest rates higher in order to slow down the economy. They do this because inflation is too high, and by reducing demand in the economy they can help bring prices down (ie slowing inflation).

To an average Joe, the higher interest rate means that loans will be more expensive (higher interest) on things like mortgages, credit cards, car loans, etc. It also means that businesses may decide to cancel projects because it's too expensive to borrow the money now. For example, a business that was going to use loans to build a new factory may cancel that project or put it on hold. As a result, this can mean less jobs and/or layoffs by some businesses. This results in a tighter budget for some working class Americans.

The upside is that this also means less spending, which means stores are going to have to keep their prices lower to attract customers. That helps keep inflation under control, which is a benefit to American workers.

Long story short, the Fed is trying to get inflation under control by slowing down the economy. They do this by raising interest rates. The ongoing debate is *how fast* to raise the rates and how high to raise them. If they go too fast, they could send the economy into severe recession. If they go too slow, inflation could keep getting higher.

The 0.25% raise is basically what everyone is expecting this month. If the Fed doesn't raise at all this month, it signals they are going to let inflation run higher because they're worried about the recent bank turmoil. If they raise it 0.5%, it means they're willing to risk more bank issues (and more market turmoil) in order to get inflation under control.

The Fed meets 8 times per year to decide whether to adjust interest rates. A single rate adjustment really isn't going to have any noticeable effect on the average Joe American. However, the cumulative total of all the rate adjustments will significantly impact the economy. Everyone in the financial world gets worked up about each new rate adjustment because they want to try to predict what it means for the future. It's sort of like a person keeping track of a basketball game on their phone. They want to know when each team scores, and they celebrate or get upset each time. However, each score doesn't really matter - it's the cumulative effect that actually affects the outcome of the game. Likewise, each individual rate adjustment doesn't mean much to the average Joe, but the financial professionals are watching it closely, just like how a basketball fan might watch the whole game, but a less interested person just wants to know who won.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcxzigt/,Dubs13151,1273,1679316611.0,2023-03-20 12:50:11,t1_jcxwj03,False,inherited,,,,,

Builders are slowing the pace of their new housing inventory generation, because of cost constraints and zoning laws.

How can you fix a system that is this corrupt and constantly in crisis? How can we fix a system where no one at the top has the best interests of the Working Class in mind?

Fascism is caused by capitalism in decline. As a way to continue capitalism. Capitalism will always end with fascism if we don't figure out a new system that gives power to the ground up, not top down.

America is destined to become fascist. It is destined to break down and fall. Capitalism cannot continue. Capitalism needs to grow, devour resources, eat and profit. When there is nowhere else to grow...and in fact degrowth is necessary in order to save the planet...and all of the resources are spread thin...it will collapse into fascism and war in order to survive. Capitalism is a very resilient beast. But it is running out of that which makes it resilient. It is in crisis. Where fascism lives.

We haven't solved these banking issues for years since 2008. We haven't fixed any of it, despite what they say. Crisis is built into the system. Every seven years or so we have a crisis that, because of how the system is built, eats the poor in order to sustain the lifestyles of the rich. It eats its own in order to survive. We need to be done with this.

Capitalism won't cure climate change, because there is no profit. Capitalism won't save the planet, because it needs to eat. Capitalism is going to end. Badly. Worse than the feudal-capitalism change. And it is going to eat us until there is no one left.

We need a new system. Capitalism served it's purpose. To get us to a place where automation can improve our lives. Where we could take care of one another. It was good for what it's purpose was. Development and growth and industry. But that time is over...because the planet is making it clear to us. But everyone loves to suck capitalism's dick and will keep us forced into this hellhole with boots on our necks, so that the rich can have their fine caviar.

jcya8an,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"well technically speaking the fed doesn’t actually print money, the US mint does. 

the way the BTFP works is that banks pledge their treasury bonds to the fed’s discount window to receive up to one year loans that can be paid back at any time before the maturity date. the value of the loan they receive is limited to the par value of the collateral pledge (i believe par value as of Mar 12, 2023 when the program began). the unsecured portion between the par and market value of these securities is protected by the exchange rate stabilization fund.

it’s just a streamlined version of the already established discount window process, minus the additional haircut applied to collateral pledge. the difference is the loan lasts a year rather than the average overnight-90 day loans offered at the discount window. the rate applied to BFTP loans is a one year fixed swap + 10 bps, but given the extended maturity of the loan the rate is comparable to the average primary credit rate over the next year. 

furthermore, the loans taken out of the btfp program are subject to recourse,  so if the bank defaults on their loan or their collateral can’t cover it, the fed and treasury can go after the banks assets. the program isn’t anywhere close to the 2008 bailout, and it’s still holding banks responsible for ensuring their own safety and soundness.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcya8an/,understated_hatpin,25,1679321699.0,2023-03-20 14:14:59,t1_jcy6egp,False,inherited,,,,,

Furthermore, the previous administration was influential in keeping rates far too low for too long through the 2009-2016 time period.  By 2013/2014, the effects of the GFC had lessened considerably.  Rates should have begun a healthy and measured climb during that time frame as well.  You know, Janet Yellen and her crowd.....

Before THAT, rates were cut to the bone in 2001 as a result of 9/11 and the dot com unravelling, and they held those rates too low all through the 2000's, until they hiked in 2006, which set off the bomb of all bombs that dropped us into the GFC.

jcz95oh,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"Indeed, we haven't seen inflation ""break"" yet back to normal levels (2-3%). That's why the Fed is still raising rates to slow the economy by hurting demand for goods and services. Note that the goal isn't to *reduce prices*, it's just to get the rate of price increases back to only 2-3% per year.

The tricky part is that Fed policy doesn't *immediately* impact prices. The impact is long and variable. That makes it a bit of a guessing game as to what the right level of interest rates are. Inflation is still high now, but if the Fed over-reacts, they could send the economy into a depression and we could see prices fall (deflation) which is also undesirable because of the fact that it usually only happens when the economy is collapsing, unemployment is very high, etc. Think 2009.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcz95oh/,Dubs13151,21,1679335904.0,2023-03-20 18:11:44,t1_jcyt9ne,False,inherited,,,,,

k3w7sl7,17296na,comment,reddit,economy,"When Oil and Gas has been substantiated by subsidies by every country on Earth, is held in a monopoly and monopsony in OPEC, but they fail in understanding that the Return on Investment for Oil and Gas is below even meaningful numbers, their only point of convention of keeping their cash cow afloat was not making the price rise too much. 

They can control that, they [OPEC+] control the supply, but if you make it so it's too expensive after the subsidies, after the market consolidation, after the intense and already established infrastructure is made and put into work, you can't give your opposition [anti-fossil fuel organizations] the economic incentive to not side with your product. 

*It's to expensive from a short term and long term lens to continue fossil fuels. The EROI average, of fossil fuels are 15:1, when 100 years ago that number was greater than 110:1. The lowest I've seen is Spain, where the EROI is so egregious, that the government itself can't in good faith [invest in it - at 2.4:1](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-leaders-gather-ahead-challenging-cop-28-2023-10-02/)

> example Prieto and Hall, 2012 calculated EROI values that incorporate most energy costs, with the assumption that where ever money was spent energy too was spent. They use data from existing installations in Spain, and derived EROI values of roughly 2.4:1, considerably lower than many less comprehensive estimates.

A general rule is if your investment rate of return is less than inflation, your investment isn't worth it. r>g and all that 

Side note: Just decided to see what Spain has been doing since that report came out [They're fazing out oil and gas subsidies, came out 4 days ago](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-leaders-gather-ahead-challenging-cop-28-2023-10-02/)

OPEC you tried your hand, governments are finding out its more *economically* imperative to get off of fossil fuels.

k3vcf0l,17296na,comment,reddit,economy,"Nope - beyond the seasonality, small increases in price can cause disproportionate response in demand.

Just think about what you mentioned - do you think the average American would agree with the statement that 'national average prices didn't go up that much'?  I do - but I think most would say gasoline is overpriced and constantly going higher.  Perception is reality, and that will cause them to back off.

Add in other inflationary pressures on the American consumer, and shit can go sideways for OPEC quickly.",https://reddit.com/r/economy/comments/17296na/gasoline_prices_are_heading_lower_after_saudi/k3vcf0l/,[deleted],6,1696696048.0,2023-10-07 16:27:28,t1_k3vahkl,False,inherited,,,,,
