If these high frequency traders were actually that good, we would have ZERO inefficiencies in the marketplace but that's not true.

This example also shows that the adjustments of the high frequency traders aren't fast either as individual investors had lots of time to buy into oil at the lows.  If an individual investor purchased oil futures as week after the lowest point when everything was ""priced in"", they would have still made a killing.

TLDR: inflation is not going to simply fade away without some period of relative pain.  It’s going to take a change to the fundamentals of the current economy to really get prices to stabilize.

Why?

Because reserves are what their production quotas are based on within the group.  So if you reduce reserves yearly (as you produce them out), but no one else does…you get to produce a smaller percentage of the pie the following year.

So, ergo, all of the reserves from OPEC members are BS.

Imports to the USA make up less than 25% of US consumption.    Reducing 1.1MM b/day is a 3% decrease to world supply and a 0.7% decrease to US supply.  I’ll suggest this is still an impactful change.  Interesting to also note,  OPEC reduced output by 2MM at the start of Biden’s term in office.   Election ‘24 is just getting started and this change might take a few months to impact the price at the pumps.  It feels political to me.   USA and Canada steadily increase production and as OPEC+ cut’s production they also lose considerable market share.

I was questioning how any of that would actually even be an issue for Shell, as you would expect both of the listed issues to benefit Shell, if anything. If that wasn't their intention and they were just feigning surprise at Shell obviously having high profits because they're pretending what was actually a bunch of good news for Shell was actually bad news, that would be a somewhat weird and pointless use of sarcasm, which is why I didn't interpret it that way.",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/137c3sv/shell_makes_965_bln_profit_in_first_quarter/jiw0mfk/,Muroid,2,1683238258.0,2023-05-04 22:10:58,t1_jivvu26,False,inherited

jfq9zp6,12hkrfw,comment,reddit,StockMarket,"In response to the Bloomberg report on the outflows from WisdomTree's Brent Crude Oil ETP (BRNT) and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (UCO), I'd say it's essential to consider the context before jumping to conclusions about the implications for the oil market. While it's true that weak demand might outweigh OPEC+'s production cuts, it's also important to remember that these funds, particularly UCO, are leveraged and subject to profit-taking after recent price spikes.  
I agree with the point about the lack of a significant fundamental basis in the data on fund outflows. It's worth noting that BRNT didn't have substantial funds prior to 2023, and the behavior of leveraged funds like UCO and 3BLR is not surprising. Investors in these funds should indeed be using them in this manner.  
In the end, I think it's crucial to separate the actions of these specific funds from the broader market dynamics and not overstate the relevance of OPEC's control over prices in this particular case.",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12hkrfw/what_could_oil_fund_outflows_mean/jfq9zp6/,marsh20202020,3,1681152412.0,2023-04-10 18:46:52,t3_12hkrfw,False,inherited
jfqk2ba,12hkrfw,comment,reddit,StockMarket,"In the oil market, no one ever accurately predicts the timing, which makes it difficult to forecast prices.

However, this isn't about how solar power, wind, and electric vehicles are transforming the market in the long run.

It's also not about whether prices will jump to $100 per barrel if the recession turns out to be less severe and China's demand recovers. Keep in mind that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is half sold out.

Conversely, it's not about whether OPEC will have to repeatedly cut production in an attempt to halt a decline, as it did from 2017 to 2019.

The future is uncertain, which is why proper positioning is more important. If there's a profit in UCO, it's crucial to lock it in and not wait for renewables to replace hydrocarbons.",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12hkrfw/what_could_oil_fund_outflows_mean/jfqk2ba/,bitkogan,2,1681156406.0,2023-04-10 19:53:26,t1_jfps8g4,True,inherited

But i do believe wind and solar are pressuring prices already.  That doesn’t mean its only 1%, still it’s becoming a factor.

China in a nutshell is a dependent country, if it continues on its path it will have very few who want to trade with it.  Cheap goods in the end leave little money in China considering they have little resources, most come from Australia.
