171isrf,post,reddit,economy,Why is the US depleting it's own oil reserves and not buying oil from other countries?,"Sounds stupid to waste the greatest source of wealth of a nation, that is energy. 

Money, bonds, debt, all of it is made up and gone with the snip of a finger, but energy is real. A barell of crude oil is the equivalent of 5 years of hard human labor.

Since 2010, shale oil is the only source that is growing in domestic crude oil production and it breaks even at 58 dollars a barrell.

Yet the cost of shale oil production is growing 8% a year, for it is harder and harder to get. Instead of printing paper, that is dollar and buying real assets, like crude oil, the US is depleting it's real assets.

Other countries can afford to keep oil in the ground and just move with the rising price of US shale oil production in balance.

There is also a fundamental misunderstanding of raw power in GDP metrics here. GDP in the US is measured with pushing houses, stocks back and forth, consumption and so on. But little actual manufactoring.

Russias GDP is way lower, but the they do have energy in the ground and they do have weapon manufactoring running. Both things enable them to wage long wars even with incompetent leadership.",https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/171isrf/why_is_the_us_depleting_its_own_oil_reserves_and/,https://reddit.com/r/economy/comments/171isrf/why_is_the_us_depleting_its_own_oil_reserves_and/,just-a-dreamer-,46,169,1696614315.0,2023-10-06 17:45:15,True,0.4927884615384615,medium
