jcy4g41,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"All of the media outlets framing this as a simple tradeoff between inflation vs bank stability are vastly oversimplifying the issue.  We're a decade late in unwinding ZIRP/QE and if the Fed flinches because a few banks are in trouble they will cause themselves a far bigger problem a few years down the road.  The Fed needs to get both the financial system and the economy overall back to an environment where real rates are positive and risk is priced appropriately.  15 years of ZIRP/QE have introduced all sorts of distortions that are going to be painful to fix, but waiting will make it worse.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcy4g41/,FuguSandwich,1899,1679319065.0,2023-03-20 13:31:05,t3_11wgwz8,False,inherited
jcxzigt,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"The Fed sets interest rates higher in order to slow down the economy. They do this because inflation is too high, and by reducing demand in the economy they can help bring prices down (ie slowing inflation).

To an average Joe, the higher interest rate means that loans will be more expensive (higher interest) on things like mortgages, credit cards, car loans, etc. It also means that businesses may decide to cancel projects because it's too expensive to borrow the money now. For example, a business that was going to use loans to build a new factory may cancel that project or put it on hold. As a result, this can mean less jobs and/or layoffs by some businesses. This results in a tighter budget for some working class Americans.

The upside is that this also means less spending, which means stores are going to have to keep their prices lower to attract customers. That helps keep inflation under control, which is a benefit to American workers.

Long story short, the Fed is trying to get inflation under control by slowing down the economy. They do this by raising interest rates. The ongoing debate is *how fast* to raise the rates and how high to raise them. If they go too fast, they could send the economy into severe recession. If they go too slow, inflation could keep getting higher.

The 0.25% raise is basically what everyone is expecting this month. If the Fed doesn't raise at all this month, it signals they are going to let inflation run higher because they're worried about the recent bank turmoil. If they raise it 0.5%, it means they're willing to risk more bank issues (and more market turmoil) in order to get inflation under control.

The Fed meets 8 times per year to decide whether to adjust interest rates. A single rate adjustment really isn't going to have any noticeable effect on the average Joe American. However, the cumulative total of all the rate adjustments will significantly impact the economy. Everyone in the financial world gets worked up about each new rate adjustment because they want to try to predict what it means for the future. It's sort of like a person keeping track of a basketball game on their phone. They want to know when each team scores, and they celebrate or get upset each time. However, each score doesn't really matter - it's the cumulative effect that actually affects the outcome of the game. Likewise, each individual rate adjustment doesn't mean much to the average Joe, but the financial professionals are watching it closely, just like how a basketball fan might watch the whole game, but a less interested person just wants to know who won.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcxzigt/,Dubs13151,1275,1679316611.0,2023-03-20 12:50:11,t1_jcxwj03,False,inherited

jcyrg54,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"> Global aggregate debt went from 70 trillion in 2007 to around 300 trillion today.  That 230 trillion in debt funded only 40 trillion in global GDP growth.

While this sounds bad, that's sort of how debt-financed GDP growth works. That *may* be an acceptable tradeoff. You're only really concerned about servicing the debt payments, so as long as taxes (to service the loans) from that GDP growth is greater than the payments, it's a ""net win. The issue today is that, with rising interest rates, it becomes harder and harder to service that debt based on the GDP growth.

jcye1b1,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,Fiscal and monetary policy are not the same. The role of the central bank is to set monetary policy through their relationship with banks and the treasury which both collectively underpin the movement and flows of money.

The workings of financial markets and fed activities are extremely complex and it helps to have a baseline understanding of what the fed does do and doesn’t do to appropriately discuss/debate.

jcywr5k,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"How can you fix a system economically that preys on the population, gives money to the rich, and leaves the poor to fend for themselves? How do you fix a system that has corruption built into it. Where big money siphoning is hard to track.and covered up? From CEOs to politicians? How can you fix a system that is this corrupt and constantly in crisis? How can we fix a system where no one at the top has the best interests of the Working Class in mind?

Fascism is caused by capitalism in decline. As a way to continue capitalism. Capitalism will always end with fascism if we don't figure out a new system that gives power to the ground up, not top down.

America is destined to become fascist. It is destined to break down and fall. Capitalism cannot continue. Capitalism needs to grow, devour resources, eat and profit. When there is nowhere else to grow...and in fact degrowth is necessary in order to save the planet...and all of the resources are spread thin...it will collapse into fascism and war in order to survive. Capitalism is a very resilient beast. But it is running out of that which makes it resilient. It is in crisis. Where fascism lives.

We haven't solved these banking issues for years since 2008. We haven't fixed any of it, despite what they say. Crisis is built into the system. Every seven years or so we have a crisis that, because of how the system is built, eats the poor in order to sustain the lifestyles of the rich. It eats its own in order to survive. We need to be done with this.

Capitalism won't cure climate change, because there is no profit. Capitalism won't save the planet, because it needs to eat. Capitalism is going to end. Badly. Worse than the feudal-capitalism change. And it is going to eat us until there is no one left.

We need a new system. Capitalism served it's purpose. To get us to a place where automation can improve our lives. Where we could take care of one another. It was good for what it's purpose was. Development and growth and industry. But that time is over...because the planet is making it clear to us. But everyone loves to suck capitalism's dick and will keep us forced into this hellhole with boots on our necks, so that the rich can have their fine caviar.

jcya8an,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"well technically speaking the fed doesn’t actually print money, the US mint does. 

the way the BTFP works is that banks pledge their treasury bonds to the fed’s discount window to receive up to one year loans that can be paid back at any time before the maturity date. the value of the loan they receive is limited to the par value of the collateral pledge (i believe par value as of Mar 12, 2023 when the program began). the unsecured portion between the par and market value of these securities is protected by the exchange rate stabilization fund.

it’s just a streamlined version of the already established discount window process, minus the additional haircut applied to collateral pledge. the difference is the loan lasts a year rather than the average overnight-90 day loans offered at the discount window. the rate applied to BFTP loans is a one year fixed swap + 10 bps, but given the extended maturity of the loan the rate is comparable to the average primary credit rate over the next year. 

furthermore, the loans taken out of the btfp program are subject to recourse,  so if the bank defaults on their loan or their collateral can’t cover it, the fed and treasury can go after the banks assets. the program isn’t anywhere close to the 2008 bailout, and it’s still holding banks responsible for ensuring their own safety and soundness.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcya8an/,understated_hatpin,24,1679321699.0,2023-03-20 14:14:59,t1_jcy6egp,False,inherited

jcyh0ol,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"Indeed.  And they capitulated.

Furthermore, the previous administration was influential in keeping rates far too low for too long through the 2009-2016 time period.  By 2013/2014, the effects of the GFC had lessened considerably.  Rates should have begun a healthy and measured climb during that time frame as well.  You know, Janet Yellen and her crowd.....

Before THAT, rates were cut to the bone in 2001 as a result of 9/11 and the dot com unravelling, and they held those rates too low all through the 2000's, until they hiked in 2006, which set off the bomb of all bombs that dropped us into the GFC.

So, you see, this goes beyond political party or any one politician.

jcz95oh,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"Indeed, we haven't seen inflation ""break"" yet back to normal levels (2-3%). That's why the Fed is still raising rates to slow the economy by hurting demand for goods and services. Note that the goal isn't to *reduce prices*, it's just to get the rate of price increases back to only 2-3% per year.

The tricky part is that Fed policy doesn't *immediately* impact prices. The impact is long and variable. That makes it a bit of a guessing game as to what the right level of interest rates are. Inflation is still high now, but if the Fed over-reacts, they could send the economy into a depression and we could see prices fall (deflation) which is also undesirable because of the fact that it usually only happens when the economy is collapsing, unemployment is very high, etc. Think 2009.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcz95oh/,Dubs13151,23,1679335904.0,2023-03-20 18:11:44,t1_jcyt9ne,False,inherited

jcz3olu,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"I have no sympathy, but at the same time the entire system is broken. Retirement and healthcare costs are unaffordable for the vast majority of people, even those who work hard and make six figures. One stroke of bad luck can undo it all. Until very recently, the supposed Middle Class hasn't had to face the cold reality of it all thanks to the push for real estate as in investment/net worth vehicle. If I had enough money to own multiple properties right now, I would too - it's one of the only reliable avenues left for building wealth if you're not a multi-millionaire.

As it is I have one home and I am very grateful to have it. A home is just that, it should only ever be a place to lay your head down; not a commodity. There is some very slight cautious optimism that as my generation becomes the dominant voting bloc in the US, there will be no choice but to restructure how we do things.
