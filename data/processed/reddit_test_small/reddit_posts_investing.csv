170cxkq,post,reddit,investing,What is driving oil prices down this week?,"Having a look at the weekly API and EIA reports over the past five months we can observe a clear trend bringing oil inventories rapidly down. On a year-over-year basis, US oil inventories have actually decreased a few million barrels. The supply tightness that led to this situation (OPEC cuts etc) still persists, which had evident effects on prices up to last week. The present week, by contrast, has seen the steepest crash in oil prices which was somehow unexpected. What are the major drivers of this sudden reversal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/170cxkq/what_is_driving_oil_prices_down_this_week/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/170cxkq/what_is_driving_oil_prices_down_this_week/,Warm-Hunt8586,60,92,1696495840.0,2023-10-05 08:50:40,True,1.0,high
17oihbh,post,reddit,investing,I see very little talk about OIL and OIL /GAS stocks.,"It is interesting to me because I have noticed they are trading at reasonable valuations, if not cheap. Many are ignoring, and hedge funds are short as ever.  


I have also noticed that there are cycles in which oil sets a new paradigm price range.  


many of the companies in this industry are buying out competitors right now, and buying back shares with big dividends.  


Warren buffets recent largest purchases are in oil companies.  


Ive put together a few charts on my tradingview account showing that it is unlikely for these assets to underperform the s&p500. In fact, it looks likely that they will outperform from here on out. I focus on Chevron, but any quality company should do well IMO.

129yyry,post,reddit,investing,OPEC+ cutting over 1.5M barrels per day in May.,"So what is the Fed going to do as inflation starts to climb dramatically driven by oil prices as banks continue to struggle (or collapse) under the weight of the hikes already completed. At this point a recession seems like the only path to bring inflation down to the 2% target and the only question is how deep of one.

1637kl2,post,reddit,investing,"Oil prices affect core inflation, which affects interest rates, which can affect equity markets. Are oil prices the only thing we should be paying attention to?","I do risk management in my profession and as someone who doesn't have a background in economics, I'm trying to figure out which risks have the highest probability. 

It seems like the market sentiment up until a couple weeks ago was that inflation would continue to moderate at a consistent pace, causing interest rates to plateau, and allowing stocks to be favorable.

In my opinion, the chances of inflation moderating at a consistent pace are low. If oil prices spike than wouldn't that cause a ripple effect of interested rates either climbing or staying at the current levels for longer? If that is the case, I would imagine there would be a slow bleed to stocks, especially the cash flow negative ones. 

There's always the chance of an unknown-unknown, Black-Swan event but what would be the most likely knowns to be the catalyst for a sell off? More banks using the repo market and failing? Credit default from commercial real estate or consumers?

I'm interested to here everyone's take. Thanks!

With the current market being what it is, and everything going on in the world, prices are going to rise right? so is anyone considering investing, why or why not? 

I was thinking yes, but im against some of the ethical issues around doing so, I guess it depends if my goal is money or something else, what do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/102pyvh/is_anyone_investing_in_oilfuelgas_right_now/,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/102pyvh/is_anyone_investing_in_oilfuelgas_right_now/,Aceofwands111,3,34,1672795630.0,2023-01-04 01:27:10,True,0.5357142857142857,medium

Saudi has cut from 12-9 m barrels produced a day allready. Is it going down further? With the downturn these past weeks as the gaza war doessn't seem to have much of an impact on the prices, and with the u.s producing more and more, wil opec concider cutting more? Wil they keep the same cuts? Perhaps, wil they revert cuts?
