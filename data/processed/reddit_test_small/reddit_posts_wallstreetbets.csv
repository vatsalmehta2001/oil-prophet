Total -> 1.6 million barrels per day

In a dramatic and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers have announced a series of cuts. This powerful alliance includes heavyweight oil producers like Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, and Algeria.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has pledged to reduce its oil output by a massive 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May until the end of 2023, in a move described by the Saudi energy ministry as a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market"". Joining the colossal effort, Russia's deputy prime minister declared that Moscow would also extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023.

Other key players in the OPEC+ alliance have stepped up with their own production cuts. The United Arab Emirates plans to cut 144,000 bpd, Kuwait with 128,000 bpd, Iraq by 211,000 bpd, Oman with 40,000 bpd, and Algeria to reduce output by 48,000 bpd. Collectively, these substantial reductions demonstrate the alliance's dedication to fostering a stable and balanced oil market.

>Oil giant Shell is doubling down on its focus on fossil fuel profits and attracting investors by announcing plans to increase shareholder payouts and reduce capital investment. The company aims to deliver a 15% dividend increase and stock buybacks of at least $5 billion in the second half of 2023. While expanding its liquefied natural gas business, Shell will also invest in ""low carbon"" technologies such as biofuels, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging, and carbon capture and storage. Notably absent from the announcement were any mentions of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

>Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, emphasized the company's commitment to providing secure energy while transforming to thrive in a low-carbon future. The goal is to create profitable business models that can be rapidly scaled to impact global energy system decarbonization. However, Shell's decision to prioritize fossil fuel investments has faced criticism from investors like the Church of England's pension funds and climate groups who accuse the company of neglecting renewable energy opportunities.

>The International Energy Agency predicts that global demand for oil used in energy will peak in five years. While Shell claims to have met its target to cut oil production ahead of schedule, it continues to face scrutiny regarding its overall production reduction goals.

„ÄêHow to Respond to Russia's Oil Production Cut„Äë

Earlier we discussed OPEC and individual oil-producing countries' lack of willingness to increase production, and even their desire to reduce production. After all, increasing production means further suppressing oil prices, while reducing production means indicating weak demand. Therefore, the joint production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia to some extent demonstrates uncertainty in demand growth and concerns about economic recession.

Compared with the potential inflation caused by reducing production, oil, as the lifeblood of industry, affects people's daily lives worldwide. Investors should be more concerned about the impact of this OPEC production cut on economic activity. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is equivalent to a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which will also suppress economic activity. Economic recession means limited room for oil price increases. Therefore, long positions in crude oil should be cautious, constantly monitoring whether oil prices break below support levels, and paying attention to shifts in the long-short style.

However, for US oil stocks, it's a win-win situation. The production cost of US shale oil is between $40-50 per barrel. US oil companies can both legitimately increase production and sell at a good price, and act as a vanguard during economic recovery. In this situation, oil stocks' buyback performance and dividend payouts are good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12fhlry/next_weeks_trading_410414_how_to_deal_with_oil/,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12fhlry/next_weeks_trading_410414_how_to_deal_with_oil/,MontedCristo,11,16,1680948699.0,2023-04-08 10:11:39,True,0.9615805604203154,high

10p596w,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,Yolo on Oil Baby! oil üõ¢Ô∏è,"
Ok, it's time we go old school and make some money with black gold, aka oil.

There are several reasons to be bullish on oil right now. This post is about oil the commodity on not necessarily oil stocks although there is some strong correlation.

Here are a few reasons why I loaded up on calls.

1. SPR (strategic petroleum reserve)-as of right now the US govt has released a lot of petroleum reserves (180 million barrels) just so your wife can drive around with her boyfriend without having to tap into your tendies. Sooner or later they have to refill the SPR. Ideally this should have been done when crude was in the $70's but that would've been the smart thing to do. However we all know that the govt is not the brightest so they refused to do so.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-06/us-rejects-oil-offers-in-first-attempt-to-replenish-stockpiles

Knowing that govt officials are not smart, it's more than likely they're going to refill when price goes up. This will continue to drive the price up and it will have the same effect as a short squeeze. 

If prices creep up again, the current administration will receive some push back from Congress. This should limit another draw down in the SPR.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/27/house-republicans-pass-bill-to-limit-strategic-petroleum-reserve-draws.html

2. China- not many people know but china has been on lockdown for the past year due to a zero Covid policy. People got upset and started protesting against the lockdowns. Now china is re-opening and things are starting to get back to normal and oil consumption is gonna increase substantially. If this demand comes to fruition then we should see oil in the triple digits.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-covid-19-reopening-set-push-2023-oil-demand-new-high-iea-2023-01-18/


3. Russia- the west is trying to be cute by imposing sanctions and price caps on Russian oil. Essentially they're telling other countries the following: Buy oil from Russia and sell it to us....just make sure you buy it cheap from Russia.

Russia retaliated by saying, if you buy oil from us, you can't sell it to the countries that placed sanctions on us.

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russias-Price-Cap-Retaliation-Could-Boost-Indias-Oil-Imports.html


4. EU's oil ban- The crude oil ban will be followed on February 5, 2023 by a ban on the imports of refined oil products.

https://www.trtworld.com/europe/europe-hoarding-russian-diesel-ahead-of-february-2023-ban-62752

This is the catalyst in my opinion. Russia is Bff with china and India. So they can sell oil to them. The plot twist is that china and India won't be able to sell it back to Europe. This will create a shortage in supply for Europe and should help oil prices go up. Fed rate hikes should also slow down which means a weaker dollar and room for oil to go up.

Here's how I'm gonna play this.

I'm bullish on oil the commodity. Forget earnings, downgrades, guidance and lawsuits. 
So I'm buying calls on $UCO which is tied directly to WTI crude oil prices. I'm buying 2024 calls because oil is pretty volatile. These should be printing by the summer. 

TLDR: oil prices are going back up due to several factors. First, the US needs to refill the SPR. Second China is re-opening after being locked down for a year and this will create more demand for oil. Third, Russian oil is coming off the European market on Feb 5th. This will create a shortage in supply. Higher demand, fewer supply means increase in prices.

I explained why they were smoke and mirror. Why you shouldn't expect any return to $122 prices. And why oil prices were actually more likely to go down.

And again with the more recent cuts. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people\_betting\_on\_oil\_stocks\_now\_because\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people_betting_on_oil_stocks_now_because_of_the/)

Now oil prices have slipped under $70.

Why have oil prices gone down for a year, when demand is supposed to have picked up with the supply chain and cruises back up, people flying and traveling again, China ending its lockdowns, the energy crisis, sanctions on Russia, and OPEC cutting its outputs?

It's a much more complex picture than that.

You have to look at all the factors at play, the context, the timing, and what's really happening. 

In the first post I explained a lot of the underlying factors that bullish people might have overlooked. 

You have to look at not just what the OPEC output targets are, but what the countries are actually producing. And everything in between from the supply chain to the refineries. 

If people who had called $100+ had looked at those, they would have instead had more expectations below $90. 

# But let's look at the present situation.

There's a ton of factors, and I recommend doing your own research and looking at each one yourself. It's a complex picture, with many moving parts. 

But one of the factors worth mentioning is Russia having to desperately unload its oil for cheap and flooding the market. On top of the gap between output and target cuts, this has also negated any of the few OPEC countries that had any real changes in output.

However, after a year of being bearish on oil prices, I'm no longer as bearish as I once was.

But I'm not bullish yet, just a little less bearish. I just think the downtrend will slow and stabilize. 

...barring any recession, housing market crash, wild OPEC shift, that could re-accelerate the downtrend. 

And that's a big if. Since I'm not feeling positive about the housing market right now, and can really see a correction. That could potentially affect the market demand. 

Plus we are currently in the prime season for oil demand. We'll be heading into the weaker months at the end of the year. 

I can see the downtrend slowing and stabilizing at best. But I'm still not seeing a big come back, or oil prices back above $100 this year.

Maybe next year oil bulls. 

# The stock side

We could however see more positives for the stock side in the energy industry.

This is where I might be even less bearish, and slightly becoming bullish. 

Looking beyond just the commodity side itself, the industry related stocks have actually not been doing that bad, all things considered. XOM, CVX, and Shell, have had somewhat of a stable trend to a mild downward trend for the past year. Smaller stock in things like oil exploration, shale industry, etc... have been a little more volatile. 

If you believe the current stock market rally is part of a long term trend for a next bull cycle, and not a bull trap, then the oil industry related stocks might be worth looking into. There is a potential for a much more positive oil market next year, and maybe more stability as early as this year. 

You also have to believe that there is no further threat of recession or some housing market crash.

And you have to believe that we're not quiet there yet with renewable energy, with electric cars, and that China, India, and Brazil will outpace that with high demand for a lot of fossil fuel vehicles.
