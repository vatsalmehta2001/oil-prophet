I'm probably getting out of both this week.  The chances of oil prices going up significantly are puny now, while a big dip is more likely.  Most likely a lot of pointless sideways volatility.

Usually in China things get slow week before and during chinese new year 22.1.2023. Most so called oil&gas expert are sayinh H2 is when things get rolling. 

DVN is my top pick for its great dividend low debt. It has low oil breakeven 30 $ bbl. 

CTRA for it 50% gas, 25% oil, 25 % NGL.
DVN 50 % oil, 25% gas, 25 NGL. 

OKE is my old pick from 2018. Safe midstream company with some gas production. Good dividend but high debt.

As for interest rates I just talking how it affect myself instead other companies. Interest rate at 5% for me means 250€ more for mortgage thus -250€ less for other things. I rather not talk about inflation and interest rates. My understanding about them is just basics.

Here is several names I as oil&gas bull follow in twitter Eric Nuttal, Amrita Sen. They got excellent charts and pictures about oil data. Also check their interview at Youtube. 

Rick Rule is one of my favourites. Look his youtube interview thesis about commodities&energy.

Ok, it's time we go old school and make some money with black gold, aka oil.

There are several reasons to be bullish on oil right now. This post is about oil the commodity on not necessarily oil stocks although there is some strong correlation.

Here are a few reasons why I loaded up on calls.

1. SPR (strategic petroleum reserve)-as of right now the US govt has released a lot of petroleum reserves (180 million barrels) just so your wife can drive around with her boyfriend without having to tap into your tendies. Sooner or later they have to refill the SPR. Ideally this should have been done when crude was in the $70's but that would've been the smart thing to do. However we all know that the govt is not the brightest so they refused to do so.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-06/us-rejects-oil-offers-in-first-attempt-to-replenish-stockpiles

Knowing that govt officials are not smart, it's more than likely they're going to refill when price goes up. This will continue to drive the price up and it will have the same effect as a short squeeze. 

If prices creep up again, the current administration will receive some push back from Congress. This should limit another draw down in the SPR.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/27/house-republicans-pass-bill-to-limit-strategic-petroleum-reserve-draws.html

2. China- not many people know but china has been on lockdown for the past year due to a zero Covid policy. People got upset and started protesting against the lockdowns. Now china is re-opening and things are starting to get back to normal and oil consumption is gonna increase substantially. If this demand comes to fruition then we should see oil in the triple digits.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-covid-19-reopening-set-push-2023-oil-demand-new-high-iea-2023-01-18/


3. Russia- the west is trying to be cute by imposing sanctions and price caps on Russian oil. Essentially they're telling other countries the following: Buy oil from Russia and sell it to us....just make sure you buy it cheap from Russia.

Russia retaliated by saying, if you buy oil from us, you can't sell it to the countries that placed sanctions on us.

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russias-Price-Cap-Retaliation-Could-Boost-Indias-Oil-Imports.html


4. EU's oil ban- The crude oil ban will be followed on February 5, 2023 by a ban on the imports of refined oil products.

https://www.trtworld.com/europe/europe-hoarding-russian-diesel-ahead-of-february-2023-ban-62752

This is the catalyst in my opinion. Russia is Bff with china and India. So they can sell oil to them. The plot twist is that china and India won't be able to sell it back to Europe. This will create a shortage in supply for Europe and should help oil prices go up. Fed rate hikes should also slow down which means a weaker dollar and room for oil to go up.

Here's how I'm gonna play this.

I'm bullish on oil the commodity. Forget earnings, downgrades, guidance and lawsuits. 
So I'm buying calls on $UCO which is tied directly to WTI crude oil prices. I'm buying 2024 calls because oil is pretty volatile. These should be printing by the summer. 

TLDR: oil prices are going back up due to several factors. First, the US needs to refill the SPR. Second China is re-opening after being locked down for a year and this will create more demand for oil. Third, Russian oil is coming off the European market on Feb 5th. This will create a shortage in supply. Higher demand, fewer supply means increase in prices. I'm gone try to Print Money Boomer Style by buying calls on $UCO which is tied directly to WTI crude oil.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10p596w/yolo_on_oil_baby_oil/,PhilosopherNutz,32,1675091716.0,2023-01-30 15:15:16,,,medium,Yolo on Oil Baby! oil 🛢️,https://i.redd.it/r9v8p1zon8fa1.png,47.0,False,0.6425131348511383,0.0,0.5810200469971891,0.4189799530028109,-0.4364262615206233,0.8665511265164645

j7syzvz,10xkwew,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"They had become dislocated. Oil prices fell much more than the stocks did, so now, with some rebound in the prices, the stocks will not correlate as much. They usually correlate with a closer relationship, so this was an uncommon dislocation if you were. Once the two reach a similar equilibrium, I think you will see it go back to normal. 

My theory is that big money knows that the decrease in oil prices is likely temporary and, therefore, they've most held on. Energy companies are still very cheap and many of them have repaired their balance sheets and are adhering to production discipline and shareholder returns. With the structural supply deficit likely to continue for some years, I don't think it is a trade to bail on now.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10xkwew/oil_stock_down_while_oil_price_up/j7syzvz/,LionRoars87,3,1675916833.0,2023-02-09 04:27:13,t3_10xkwew,False,inherited,,,,,,0.22890929791123368,0.43775534803091093,0.3333353540578554,-0.13800579656002135,0.6201550387596899

If these high frequency traders were actually that good, we would have ZERO inefficiencies in the marketplace but that's not true.  If it was true, individual investors would not have been able to double, triple, quadruple...their money by buying oil when it went below zero as those high frequency traders would have never let it happen!  This example also shows that the adjustments of the high frequency traders aren't fast either as individual investors had lots of time to buy into oil at the lows.  If an individual investor purchased oil futures as week after the lowest point when everything was ""priced in"", they would have still made a killing.

11prsna,,post,reddit,stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/12/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-posts-record-161point1-billion-profit-for-2022.html

Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled oil giant Aramco on Sunday reported a record net income of $161.1 billion for 2022 — the largest annual profit ever achieved by an oil and gas company.

Aramco said net income increased 46.5 percent over the year, from $110 billion in 2021. Free cash flow also reached a record $148.5 billion in 2022, compared with $107.5 billion in 2021. 

“This is probably the highest net income ever recorded in the corporate world,” Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said on a Sunday earnings call. 

The results are nearly triple the profit that oil major ExxonMobil posted for 2022, bolstered by soaring oil and gas prices through last year, along with higher sale volumes and improved margins for refined products. 

Oil and gas prices surged at the start of 2022, with western sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine steadily tightening access to Moscow’s supplies, particularly seaborne crude and oil products.

Oil prices have since pulled back more than 25% year-on-year, with hot inflation and rising interest rates overshadowing a more bullish demand outlook from China. Brent and WTI prices fell 6% last week alone. Brent last traded at around $80 dollars per barrel. 

“We are cautiously optimistic,” Nasser said. “If you consider China opening up, the pickup in jet fuels and the very limited spare capacity, we are cautiously optimistic in the short to mid-term [that] markets will remain tightly balanced.”

Aramco raised its fourth-quarter dividend by 4% to $19.5 billion, to be paid in the first quarter of 2023. Aramco also said it would issue bonus shares to eligible shareholders as a result. 

“We’re aiming to sustain [the dividend] at this level,” Aramco Chief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed told the earnings call. “We have the financial strength to go through the ups and downs of the cycle.”

Nasser also used the results release to repeat his warning about “persistent underinvestment” in the hydrocarbons sector. 

“Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real, including contributing to higher energy prices,” Nasser said on Sunday, echoing comments made during a recent interview with CNBC.

At both a ministerial and Aramco level, Saudi Arabia has been a proponent of avoiding short-term fuel shortages through the dual funding of fossil fuel supplies and the green transition.

“We don’t see enough investment getting into the markets right now,” he reiterated on the Sunday call. “We encourage the industry, policymakers, investors… to avail additional investment to really increase the amount in the sector, so that we can meet future demand.”

Aramco said average hydrocarbon production last year was 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 11.5 million barrels per day of total liquids. Saudi Arabia most recently produced 10.39 million barrels per day of crude oil in January, the International Energy Agency found in the February issue of its Oil Market Report.

As chair of the influential OPEC+ producers’ alliance, Saudi Arabia has been leading by example the group’s efforts to collectively reduce their output targets by 2 million barrels per day, agreed in October and reaffirmed at technical and ministerial meetings since. The group’s move towards limiting supply availabilities has put OPEC+ at odds with some international consumers, sparking a war of words with Washington towards the end of the last year, as U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration stressed the need to easing the burden on households.

Long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran on Friday struck a China-brokered deal to resume diplomatic relations. Iran has previously been blamed for a major attack on Aramco’s facilities in 2019 that caused a dramatic spike in prices and undermined the stability of global supplies. Tehran has denied involvement.

“The deal will hopefully result in less geopolitical tension and enhance regional stability, which will definitely have a positive impact on the global market,” Nasser said in response to a question about the Saudi-Iran development.

The company reaffirmed it would continue to invest to increase its maximum production capacity to 13 million barrels a day by 2027.

Capital expenditure rose by 18% to $37.6 billion last year, and is expected to increase to $45 billion to $55 billion in the coming years, anticipating increases “until around the middle of the decade.”

“Our focus is not only on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production, but also investing in new lower-carbon technologies with potential to achieve additional emission reductions in our own operations and for end users of our products,” Nasser said.",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11prsna/saudi_oil_giant_aramco_posts_record_161_billion/,Puginator,98,1678659699.0,2023-03-12 22:21:39,,,low,Saudi oil giant Aramco posts record $161 billion profit for 2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11prsna/saudi_oil_giant_aramco_posts_record_161_billion/,18.0,True,0.3592180123471734,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.1422197395578768,0.49868766404199477

jcxzigt,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"The Fed sets interest rates higher in order to slow down the economy. They do this because inflation is too high, and by reducing demand in the economy they can help bring prices down (ie slowing inflation).

To an average Joe, the higher interest rate means that loans will be more expensive (higher interest) on things like mortgages, credit cards, car loans, etc. It also means that businesses may decide to cancel projects because it's too expensive to borrow the money now. For example, a business that was going to use loans to build a new factory may cancel that project or put it on hold. As a result, this can mean less jobs and/or layoffs by some businesses. This results in a tighter budget for some working class Americans.

The upside is that this also means less spending, which means stores are going to have to keep their prices lower to attract customers. That helps keep inflation under control, which is a benefit to American workers.

Long story short, the Fed is trying to get inflation under control by slowing down the economy. They do this by raising interest rates. The ongoing debate is *how fast* to raise the rates and how high to raise them. If they go too fast, they could send the economy into severe recession. If they go too slow, inflation could keep getting higher.

The 0.25% raise is basically what everyone is expecting this month. If the Fed doesn't raise at all this month, it signals they are going to let inflation run higher because they're worried about the recent bank turmoil. If they raise it 0.5%, it means they're willing to risk more bank issues (and more market turmoil) in order to get inflation under control.

The Fed meets 8 times per year to decide whether to adjust interest rates. A single rate adjustment really isn't going to have any noticeable effect on the average Joe American. However, the cumulative total of all the rate adjustments will significantly impact the economy. Everyone in the financial world gets worked up about each new rate adjustment because they want to try to predict what it means for the future. It's sort of like a person keeping track of a basketball game on their phone. They want to know when each team scores, and they celebrate or get upset each time. However, each score doesn't really matter - it's the cumulative effect that actually affects the outcome of the game. Likewise, each individual rate adjustment doesn't mean much to the average Joe, but the financial professionals are watching it closely, just like how a basketball fan might watch the whole game, but a less interested person just wants to know who won.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcxzigt/,Dubs13151,1275,1679316611.0,2023-03-20 12:50:11,t1_jcxwj03,False,inherited,,,,,,0.04040638357400894,0.38752007484436035,0.5720735192298889,-0.3471136912703514,0.08771929824561403

jcya8an,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"well technically speaking the fed doesn’t actually print money, the US mint does. 

the way the BTFP works is that banks pledge their treasury bonds to the fed’s discount window to receive up to one year loans that can be paid back at any time before the maturity date. the value of the loan they receive is limited to the par value of the collateral pledge (i believe par value as of Mar 12, 2023 when the program began). the unsecured portion between the par and market value of these securities is protected by the exchange rate stabilization fund.

it’s just a streamlined version of the already established discount window process, minus the additional haircut applied to collateral pledge. the difference is the loan lasts a year rather than the average overnight-90 day loans offered at the discount window. the rate applied to BFTP loans is a one year fixed swap + 10 bps, but given the extended maturity of the loan the rate is comparable to the average primary credit rate over the next year. 

furthermore, the loans taken out of the btfp program are subject to recourse,  so if the bank defaults on their loan or their collateral can’t cover it, the fed and treasury can go after the banks assets. the program isn’t anywhere close to the 2008 bailout, and it’s still holding banks responsible for ensuring their own safety and soundness.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcya8an/,understated_hatpin,24,1679321699.0,2023-03-20 14:14:59,t1_jcy6egp,False,inherited,,,,,,0.026394030079245567,0.044059764593839645,0.9295462369918823,-0.017665734514594078,0.0425531914893617

Before THAT, rates were cut to the bone in 2001 as a result of 9/11 and the dot com unravelling, and they held those rates too low all through the 2000's, until they hiked in 2006, which set off the bomb of all bombs that dropped us into the GFC.

jcywr5k,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"How can you fix a system economically that preys on the population, gives money to the rich, and leaves the poor to fend for themselves? How do you fix a system that has corruption built into it. Where big money siphoning is hard to track.and covered up? From CEOs to politicians? How can you fix a system that is this corrupt and constantly in crisis? How can we fix a system where no one at the top has the best interests of the Working Class in mind?

Fascism is caused by capitalism in decline. As a way to continue capitalism. Capitalism will always end with fascism if we don't figure out a new system that gives power to the ground up, not top down.

America is destined to become fascist. It is destined to break down and fall. Capitalism cannot continue. Capitalism needs to grow, devour resources, eat and profit. When there is nowhere else to grow...and in fact degrowth is necessary in order to save the planet...and all of the resources are spread thin...it will collapse into fascism and war in order to survive. Capitalism is a very resilient beast. But it is running out of that which makes it resilient. It is in crisis. Where fascism lives.

We haven't solved these banking issues for years since 2008. We haven't fixed any of it, despite what they say. Crisis is built into the system. Every seven years or so we have a crisis that, because of how the system is built, eats the poor in order to sustain the lifestyles of the rich. It eats its own in order to survive. We need to be done with this.

Capitalism won't cure climate change, because there is no profit. Capitalism won't save the planet, because it needs to eat. Capitalism is going to end. Badly. Worse than the feudal-capitalism change. And it is going to eat us until there is no one left.

We need a new system. Capitalism served it's purpose. To get us to a place where automation can improve our lives. Where we could take care of one another. It was good for what it's purpose was. Development and growth and industry. But that time is over...because the planet is making it clear to us. But everyone loves to suck capitalism's dick and will keep us forced into this hellhole with boots on our necks, so that the rich can have their fine caviar.

jcz95oh,11wgwz8,comment,reddit,Economics,"Indeed, we haven't seen inflation ""break"" yet back to normal levels (2-3%). That's why the Fed is still raising rates to slow the economy by hurting demand for goods and services. Note that the goal isn't to *reduce prices*, it's just to get the rate of price increases back to only 2-3% per year.

The tricky part is that Fed policy doesn't *immediately* impact prices. The impact is long and variable. That makes it a bit of a guessing game as to what the right level of interest rates are. Inflation is still high now, but if the Fed over-reacts, they could send the economy into a depression and we could see prices fall (deflation) which is also undesirable because of the fact that it usually only happens when the economy is collapsing, unemployment is very high, etc. Think 2009.",https://reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11wgwz8/fed_poised_to_approve_quarterpoint_rate_hike_this/jcz95oh/,Dubs13151,23,1679335904.0,2023-03-20 18:11:44,t1_jcyt9ne,False,inherited,,,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.885159341951034,0.3571428571428571

🇴🇲 Oman 40,000

Total -> 1.6 million barrels per day

In a dramatic and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers have announced a series of cuts. This powerful alliance includes heavyweight oil producers like Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, and Algeria.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has pledged to reduce its oil output by a massive 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May until the end of 2023, in a move described by the Saudi energy ministry as a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market"". Joining the colossal effort, Russia's deputy prime minister declared that Moscow would also extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023.

Other key players in the OPEC+ alliance have stepped up with their own production cuts. The United Arab Emirates plans to cut 144,000 bpd, Kuwait with 128,000 bpd, Iraq by 211,000 bpd, Oman with 40,000 bpd, and Algeria to reduce output by 48,000 bpd. Collectively, these substantial reductions demonstrate the alliance's dedication to fostering a stable and balanced oil market.

Oil supplies demand curve works in both directions, ev’s and solar/wind are probably starting to have some serious impacts.  Although projections are still going up on global usage.

The usa can always stop USA production from being exported however some has to be for refining.  This would make oil cheap in the usa and expensive everywhere else.

This is getting much more complicated now, will be interesting to see this play out.

129pcf4,,post,reddit,stocks,"DUBAI, April 2 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers on Sunday announced voluntary cuts to their production amounting to around 1.15 million barrels per day in a surprise move they said was aimed at supporting market stability.

The group had been largely expected to stick to its already agreed 2 million bpd cuts when its ministerial panel, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, meets virtually on Monday.

Last October, OPEC+, which comprises the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, agreed output cuts of 2 million bpd from November until the end of the year, angering Washington as tighter supply boosts oil prices.

The U.S. has argued that the world needs lower prices to support economic growth and prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from earning more revenue to fund the Ukraine war.

Sunday's unexpected voluntary cuts, which start from May, come in addition to the ones already agreed in October.

Riyadh said it would cut output by 500,000 bpd while Iraq will reduce its production by 211,000 bpd, according to official statements.

The UAE said it would cut production by 144,000 bpd, Kuwait announced a cut of 128,000 bpd while Oman announced a cut of 40,000 bpd and Algeria said it would cut its output by 48,000 bpd. Kazakhstan will also cut output by 78,000 bpd.

Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak also said on Sunday that Moscow would extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023. Moscow announced those cuts unilaterally in February following the introduction of Western price caps.

After Russia's unilateral reductions, U.S. officials said its alliance with other OPEC members was weakening, but Sunday's move shows the cooperation is still strong.

The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement that the kingdom's voluntary cut was a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.

Oil prices fell to 15-month lows earlier this month in response to the banking crisis that followed the collapse of two U.S. lenders and resulted in Credit Suisse being rescued by Switzerland's biggest bank UBS.

It strengthens the deepening foreign policy narrative of OPEC countries aligning interest with Russia.  We already know China has aligned with Russia (container shipments have been increasing for months now).  India has always sided with Russia since Marxist days.

jeojkpz,129nfz8,comment,reddit,StockMarket,"Every member of OPEC purposely fabricates reserves.

Why?

Because reserves are what their production quotas are based on within the group.  So if you reduce reserves yearly (as you produce them out), but no one else does…you get to produce a smaller percentage of the pie the following year.

So, ergo, all of the reserves from OPEC members are BS.  Go look up historical reserves for them, they are all very very stagnant compared to public Western companies that have to report those (more or less) transparently through third party evaluators.",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/129nfz8/opec_makes_surprise_1_millionbarrel_oil/jeojkpz/,CarRamRob,16,1680455792.0,2023-04-02 17:16:32,t1_jeohcup,False,inherited,,,,,,0.0,0.5225683451108225,0.4774316548891775,-0.4106607437952534,0.8791208791208792

TLDR: inflation is not going to simply fade away without some period of relative pain.  It’s going to take a change to the fundamentals of the current economy to really get prices to stabilize.

jeorf69,129nfz8,comment,reddit,StockMarket,"After a little DD.   OPEC+ produces somewhere between 35-40MM B/day and that provides roughy 35% of world energy needs.  Imports to the USA make up less than 25% of US consumption.    Reducing 1.1MM b/day is a 3% decrease to world supply and a 0.7% decrease to US supply.  I’ll suggest this is still an impactful change.  Interesting to also note,  OPEC reduced output by 2MM at the start of Biden’s term in office.   Election ‘24 is just getting started and this change might take a few months to impact the price at the pumps.  It feels political to me.   USA and Canada steadily increase production and as OPEC+ cut’s production they also lose considerable market share.

I think this has always been the case.

The scale of money supply growth was crazy big after 2020 and came off the back of a decade of exceptionally low rates.  Too much liquidity, built up over too long, being managed without care because risk mgmt didn't really matter.

jepn69l,129pcf4,comment,reddit,stocks,"Biden & his administration have been trying to drive oil prices down by releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, pressuring other countries to produce more, approving more oil fields to open. 

The problem is that prices are climbing because of increasing and historic levels of energy demand. There is no emphasis on restraint of energy consumption, or consumption of any type. 

In this situation, the only restraint on energy consumption IS high prices. This is why environmentalists have been trying to shut down oil fields and restrict production all these years. High energy prices are the cure for excessive energy demand.

By increasing production and suppressing oil & gas prices, Biden is engaging in straight up climate change denier policy, and promoting more energy consumption.

> I guarantee you 100% you people would be blaming him for higher prices if he didn't do what he did.

Of course they would. Because online communities are only for climate change mitigation when it consists of promoting Tesla & EVs and other cool technology. They aren't interested in boring hardships like cutting consumption.

jeqi5g4,129yyry,comment,reddit,investing,"How the Russia price shock should have gone down is:

US opens the SPR.

At the same time, permitting is expedited, US production is increased (both short and long term) and contracts are made to refill the SPR. If we are still in crisis when those contracts are due, that new production is diverted to the market instead of the SPR.

Basically, if someone produces less, we produce more. That way, people who don't have out best interest in mind can't control the price. The US controls (or at least, heavily influences) the price, using its production and SPR capacity.

P.S.

The government had a ban on exported oil from 1975 to 2015. The constitution grants the Federal government the power to regulate (up to and including a ban) on international trade.

jerqs9v,129yyry,comment,reddit,investing,"People dont like facts? You dont like facts. It's sad that peopel talk so lightly about this topic.

New nuclear is incredibly expensive

[https://www.lazard.com/media/sptlfats/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-150-vf.pdf](https://www.lazard.com/media/sptlfats/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-150-vf.pdf)

Lazard put nuclear in the 131-204 USD/MWh range (unsubsidized), while utility PV is around 28-41 USD/MWh range. Even PV + 4 hours battery is around the 50-60 USD/MW.

&#x200B;

The EIA is much more generous for the nuclear sector, as the nuclear lobby has much more influence in producing it. And it estimates the cost of new nuclear in around 90 USD/MWh.

Simulations to have at least 90% renewable energy, only requires 1.3 overcapacity installation. When solar+wind is at least x3 cheaper, even if you need to build 30% extra, it's still less than half the cost of nuclear. And those simulations are pretty conservative. With better storage technology, and better international connections, it's going to be even easier.

&#x200B;

For example, in Spain we are covering 50% of demand of the first 3 months of 2023 with solar + wind, and Spain is kind of energetically isolated. It isn't like Denmark, that can produce a lot of wind, and export/import from Germany/Sweden whatever it needs when there isn't wind.

Right now, the market says that Solar PV + Wind is muuuuuuuch cheaper than nuclear. All the nuclear power plants built in the West in the last 20 years (France,USA, Finland, France, and Chech Republic) were an economic disaster, with costs x3-5 higher than the initial budget and with a minimum of a decade of delays. All of them except one (Finland) required public money direct, or indirectly. And the only case it was a private company, they cancelled 2 other reactors because of the costs of the first one. The market is very clear, nuclear isn't economical since a long time ago.

&#x200B;

So please, take your time to read on the topic and stop spreading misinformation about the nuclear energy as a future solution. It isn't because it's so expensive.",https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/129yyry/opec_cutting_over_15m_barrels_per_day_in_may/jerqs9v/,GranPino,13,1680518124.0,2023-04-03 10:35:24,t1_jeqkiok,False,inherited,,,,,,0.05795661360025406,0.15316025912761688,0.7888831496238708,-0.09520364552736282,0.15337423312883436

You're confusing vaccinated with vaccination + latest booster. These are *not* the same thing. The boosters are more like the seasonal flu shot than the original vaccine.

As for my last post, also drum the CDC:

>If you test positive for COVID-19, stay home for at least 5 days and isolate from others in your home.

>After you have ended isolation, when you are feeling better (no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and symptoms improving)...wear your mask through day 10.

12fhlry,,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,"[Large Band Cycle] Reference Cycle: Daily K~Weekly K (suitable for fund technical analysis)
WTI crude oil: the current price is $80.46. On the daily chart, oil prices continued to rise last week with OPEC's assistance, breaking through all the pressure levels on the daily chart. On the weekly chart, the defense was successful after breaking through the pressure level of $79.5, and oil is expected to enter a mid-term upward trend. This week, long positions have been established in crude oil, and positions will be added if the support level of $79.5 is not broken. Reference ETFs: SCO, UCO, and domestic oil and gas funds.

NG natural gas: the current price is $2.035. On the daily chart, natural gas prices fluctuated downwards and fell below $2 with no rebound in sight, waiting for summer, and not considering adding long positions at this time. The support level is around $1.6. Reference ETFs: BOIL, KOLD.

NQ Nasdaq 100: the current price is $13,184.25. On the daily chart, it still maintains a bullish trend, but the upward momentum is weakening on the weekly chart, and the resistance level above is 13,494. This week, one-quarter of the long positions have been reduced, and if the breakthrough is unlikely next week, long positions will continue to be reduced. 
This week, US employment and retail data have gradually weakened, and inflation seems to continue to fall. However, the 3.5% unemployment rate on Friday is creating momentum for the rate hike in May. The black swan events in the news have made fundamental analysis confusing, so it is still important to focus on technical analysis. After all, all information serves the K-line. Reference ETFs: SQQQ, TQQQ, and domestic Nasdaq tracking funds.

FTSE China H50: the current price is 13,390. On the daily chart, H50 fell back after touching the resistance level of 13,707 on April 3, but is still above the support level of 13,065. On the weekly chart, there is no big problem with the resistance level of 13,400. Hold long positions next week. Reference ETFs: YINN, YANG, and domestic Hang Seng Technology Index tracking funds.

【How to Respond to Russia's Oil Production Cut】

Earlier we discussed OPEC and individual oil-producing countries' lack of willingness to increase production, and even their desire to reduce production. After all, increasing production means further suppressing oil prices, while reducing production means indicating weak demand. Therefore, the joint production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia to some extent demonstrates uncertainty in demand growth and concerns about economic recession.

Compared with the potential inflation caused by reducing production, oil, as the lifeblood of industry, affects people's daily lives worldwide. Investors should be more concerned about the impact of this OPEC production cut on economic activity. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is equivalent to a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which will also suppress economic activity. Economic recession means limited room for oil price increases. Therefore, long positions in crude oil should be cautious, constantly monitoring whether oil prices break below support levels, and paying attention to shifts in the long-short style.

Another fund, the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (**UCO**), saw outflows of $158.5 million last week, marking its biggest weekly decline since March 2022.

Bloomberg considers this a sign for concern that weak demand will outweigh OPEC+'s sharp production cuts. Is this likely? Probably.

Moreover, the arguments about a lack of available capacity (space capacity) — an explanation that OPEC representatives are fond of using — will now sound less convincing.

However, it's not necessary to look for a significant fundamental basis in the data on fund outflows.

With the exception of a couple of anomalous inflows and outflows in 2018-19, **BRNT** didn't have substantial funds before 2023.

**UCO**, on the other hand, is a **leveraged fund**. After the recent price spike, profit-taking is logical. If it doesn’t claim the windfall now, the subsequent volatility will effectively reduce it.

By the way, WisdomTree also has an oil fund with a 3x leverage – **3BLR**. It lost $23 million, which represents 80% of assets at the beginning of last week.

Again, this is not surprising. Leveraged funds should be used precisely in this way.

OPEC's ability or inability to control prices **is irrelevant in this case**.",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12hkrfw/what_could_oil_fund_outflows_mean/,bitkogan,16,1681137568.0,2023-04-10 14:39:28,,,high,What Could Oil Fund Outflows Mean?,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12hkrfw/what_could_oil_fund_outflows_mean/,4.0,True,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,-1.2507505963465808,0.6194690265486725

jfq9zp6,12hkrfw,comment,reddit,StockMarket,"In response to the Bloomberg report on the outflows from WisdomTree's Brent Crude Oil ETP (BRNT) and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (UCO), I'd say it's essential to consider the context before jumping to conclusions about the implications for the oil market. While it's true that weak demand might outweigh OPEC+'s production cuts, it's also important to remember that these funds, particularly UCO, are leveraged and subject to profit-taking after recent price spikes.  
I agree with the point about the lack of a significant fundamental basis in the data on fund outflows. It's worth noting that BRNT didn't have substantial funds prior to 2023, and the behavior of leveraged funds like UCO and 3BLR is not surprising. Investors in these funds should indeed be using them in this manner.  
In the end, I think it's crucial to separate the actions of these specific funds from the broader market dynamics and not overstate the relevance of OPEC's control over prices in this particular case.",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/12hkrfw/what_could_oil_fund_outflows_mean/jfq9zp6/,marsh20202020,3,1681152412.0,2023-04-10 18:46:52,t3_12hkrfw,False,inherited,,,,,,0.0938518353533454,0.08874424506069684,0.8174039195859577,0.0035204009675398103,0.853658536585366
jfqk2ba,12hkrfw,comment,reddit,StockMarket,"In the oil market, no one ever accurately predicts the timing, which makes it difficult to forecast prices.

However, this isn't about how solar power, wind, and electric vehicles are transforming the market in the long run.

It's also not about whether prices will jump to $100 per barrel if the recession turns out to be less severe and China's demand recovers. Keep in mind that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is half sold out.

Conversely, it's not about whether OPEC will have to repeatedly cut production in an attempt to halt a decline, as it did from 2017 to 2019.

The future is uncertain, which is why proper positioning is more important.

But i do believe wind and solar are pressuring prices already.  That doesn’t mean its only 1%, still it’s becoming a factor.

China in a nutshell is a dependent country, if it continues on its path it will have very few who want to trade with it.  Cheap goods in the end leave little money in China considering they have little resources, most come from Australia.

jiw0mfk,137c3sv,comment,reddit,StockMarket,"No, the sarcasm was obvious. I just interpreted it as a pointed critique of Shell rather than just a pointless inversion of reality, which would imply that they think that news *would* be bad for Shell, but apparently either not as bad as it was made out to be, or that Shell found ways to squeeze consumers for extra profit to more than make up for the issues it faced.

I was questioning how any of that would actually even be an issue for Shell, as you would expect both of the listed issues to benefit Shell, if anything. If that wasn't their intention and they were just feigning surprise at Shell obviously having high profits because they're pretending what was actually a bunch of good news for Shell was actually bad news, that would be a somewhat weird and pointless use of sarcasm, which is why I didn't interpret it that way.",https://reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/137c3sv/shell_makes_965_bln_profit_in_first_quarter/jiw0mfk/,Muroid,2,1683238258.0,2023-05-04 22:10:58,t1_jivvu26,False,inherited,,,,,,0.03685802221298218,0.5759752988815308,0.38716670870780945,-0.5391172766685486,0.0

Russia had to find new buyers. That takes ALOT OF TIME AND MONEY. After a year they finally developed some limited capacity to send oil to China and India.

Oil went back down to where it was before Ukraine was invaded. Russia found its buyers.

Now that Russia’s inventory is being offloaded, the world is back to being overloaded with oil just like before/during COVID.

140ycrw,,post,reddit,stocks,"I recently wrote an article that startled me with its reaction. Over 330,000 people read it in two days on Reddit alone. It was We Have Had 2 Recessions And 2 Bear Markets in 3 Years, Will It Be 3 In Just 4 Years?   I suggest reading it first.  It starts with ""I have watched the stock market since the 1970s. Never in my life have I seen so many people think a recession was coming before. Yet this has gone on for about 9 months, and still no recession. ""

This Friday, 6-2-2023, was a breakout day for both the SP500 and the Russell 2000 (small caps).  The SP500 did a Cup and Handle breakout and the Russell a flat bottom base breakout.  The NASDAQ 100 has already broken out, for a while.  Yes, there are all sorts of bad things and stock valuations are poor.  But does that mean the stock market will not go up?  Look at 2020 and 2021 as recent examples of bad problems and extremely high valuations, and the stock market still went up big anyway.  We have had two bear markets in the last 3 years, a rare event. One other factor. Oil stocks are at arguably the best valuations ever and maybe the best sector valuation ever.  The Russell small caps recently made new lows in its ongoing bear market, which after Friday, is maybe over.  The Russell blew away the NASDAQ on Friday, in terms of gains.

What happened on Friday? Well, the debt ceiling was kicked down the road as it always is and the Jobs report fooled everyone again This has been going on for about 9 months now, with almost everyone bearish and expecting a recession.  The jobs market is actually hot.  This was not predicted at all.

I totally agree with people like Danny Moses, Guy Adami, Carter Worth and Dan Nathan that point out all the bad things as they do in this video, but does that mean we will crash, as they have been expecting for months?  They do a good job of making the bear case, but then what happened? The next day the Russell broke out of that range they talked about containing it, on their chart.  YouTube link to that will be in comments.

**So, will the economy fool everyone and not go into recession?  Maybe, and sure has so far.**

**To the last question Where Do Oil Stocks Go from Here?**  This one I am much surer of; in my opinion they will go into a historic bull market.  I have already experienced one, having bought them heavily in 2020 COVID crash.  Received several 10x and 20x movers and just about any oil stock did a 5x in that rally.

Here is a happy story of what is possible in such bull markets in oil stocks.  I bought Cardinal, a Canadian oil stock. Got a 20 bagger and now it has a 1% a month roughly dividend.  Yes, that means I am roughly getting 200% yearly dividends now and have been getting them for a while.  And in the last month have bought more Cardinal. At 1% dividend a month on a 4 PE stock with a CROIC of 30%, it is still a great deal. The valuations are better now than in 2020 for oil stocks.  Back then they were in danger of going under, but dirt cheap.  Now dirt cheap at higher prices, yet much higher safety with wonderful balance sheets and cash flows.

These two charts show that oil stocks are dirt cheap and spending less on CapEx than ever before, as a percent of Cash Flow.  This time is different, they are not overinvesting as they did every time before when oil went over $100.   Again, link in comments.

Eric Nuttal, who runs Canada's biggest oil stock fund, talked about the coming oil stock bull market in a recent video.  About how buybacks can drive a $20 oil stocks to over $1 million a share, unless they go up greatly before the buyouts complete.  Do not scoff, he is right.  He makes the case for oil stocks and high cashflow oil stock buybacks so well in this video, I will not comment myself.  The whole thing is worth viewing, but this link starts where he talks buybacks.

On buybacks will do some math here.  In this case if a stock started at $20 a share, $1 billion FCF and mkt cap of $3 billion = 150 million shares you will get to $1 billion a share in 3 years if 100% of FCF goes to buybacks and stock does not go up before then. If it rerates to 9x FCF after 1 year then was 3x FCF, 33% of stock removed = 100,000,000 shares and $9 billion market cap = $90 a share a 4.5 X gain in one year.

Reality today June 2023 is the best, we have had big buybacks and prices have stayed about the same in last 12 months on oil stocks. Debt is way down, so they have more money for buybacks.

So, let's go 1 more year at current prices. $1 billion FCF is spent buying back stock. That is 50% of stock left, so now just 50,000,000 shares left. Then it goes to 9 FCF (still cheaper than avg stock out there) so $9 billion mkt cap / 50,000,000 shares left = $180 a share, so a X gain. Pretty good.

Let's go 1 more year. Let's say the market was as stupid as it was in 6-2022 to 6-2023 and price stays the same. That means the remaining 50,000,000 shares are bot back, except for just 1 share. Then it goes to 9 X FCF = $9 billion mkt cap and 1 share = $9 Billion a share.  A 450 million times gain.  This will not happen because eventually the market wakes up to how stupid it has been after 10?, 20?, 50? times increase in earnings per share, and it rerates the stock way higher, until it no longer is worth buying back.  In fact, the company might sell some back for 20 times more than they bought it for, if it makes sense to.  Also, if a company gets 2/3s of its stock back, then its EPS going forward, for every Q, will be 3 times higher.

As an example of what can happen with buybacks with far inferior cashflows, and valuations is Teledyne.  George Roberts, who worked alongside Singleton, described the experience like this:

Henry was quoted as saying, with a laugh, “In October, 1972, we tendered for one million shares and 8.9 million came in. We took them all at $20 and figured it was a fluke, and that we couldn’t do it again. But instead of going up, our stock went down. So we kept tendering, first at $14 and then doing two bonds-for-stock swaps. Every time one tender was over the stock would go down and we’d tender again, and we’d get a new deluge. Then two more tenders at $18 and $40.”

The first six buybacks were all in the period from 1972 to 1976. The market reacted adversely to this at first, not understanding what Henry was accomplishing. But as the number of shares went down and the company’s operating income continued to grow, the earnings per share increased rapidly and dramatically. In 1970, net income per share was $1.64. By 1975 it was $6.09 per share; in 1976, $10.79; and in 1977, $16.23 per share.

With the first six stock buybacks, a total of some 22 million Teledyne share were repurchased, reducing the number of outstanding common shares to less than 12 million. A seventh stock buyback offer was made in 1980 and the final one in 1984, at the extraordinarily high price of $200 per share. This was about $30 above the current market price and eight million shares were bought back. By September of that year the stock had climbed to $302 per share and was the highest priced stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

The total value of these buybacks was over $2.5 billion, and more than 85 percent of common shares were retired. Shares outstanding had dropped from 88,827,372 in 1971 to 22,564,756 in 1980. Henry also purchased another 5 percent of Teledyne shares on the open market at various times, bringing the buyback total in the years 1972-1984 to over 90 percent of the company’s shares.

Singleton eventually paid off the debt used to buy back shares. By 1985, net income per share was $46.66. The buybacks created a compounding effect on earnings per share.

Remember oil stocks that are doing, or about to do, buybacks are at about 3-7 times better valuations than Teledyne, so they can compound better.  Teledyne was never in a position to buy back at a fast enough rate, so that all of their stock could be bought back in 3-4 years, just with free cash flow.  So, Teledyne was not even close to being able to do what oil stocks can do today.

An example is Cenovus.  As Nuttal pointed out CVE has committed to 100% of FCF to go to buybacks soon, after debt drops. They can buy back all their stock in less than 4 years, unless the stock rerates higher.  Teledyne was never even close to being capable to do that.

We just got a kicker for oil stocks, one guessed was coming, just a matter of size. 

Sunday (Bloomberg) -- Oil advanced at the week’s open after Saudi Arabia said it will make an extra 1 million barrel-a-day supply cut in July, taking its production to the lowest level for several years following a slide in prices.  
West Texas Intermediate futures jumped almost 5% early in the session before paring some gains to trade near $74 a barrel. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said he “will do whatever is necessary to bring stability to this market” following a tense OPEC+ meeting over the weekend.  
“The oil market now looks like it will be even tighter in the second half of the year,” ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. analysts Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes wrote in a note. “The move by Saudi Arabia is likely to come as a surprise.”",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/140ycrw/is_the_bear_market_over_will_the_economy_fool/,DarpResearch,61,1685930006.0,2023-06-05 01:53:26,,,medium,Is The Bear Market Over?

According to Rystad Energy’s senior vice president of oil market research, Jorge Leon, the Saudi oil output cut would only have a short-term effect on market prices unless it was extended beyond July, when it will enter into effect.  
The additional cut, he told the AP, provides “a price floor because the Saudis can play with the voluntary cut as much as they like.”

jn0psem,140ycrw,comment,reddit,stocks,"Disney has a linear cable problem, especially with ESPN.  Netflix is not bogged down by the burden and can double down on its content/growth initiatives.

That being said Netflix is already being richly rewarded in the public market ... increasingly so each day.  24x+ EV-EBITDA.

Disney is at a more manageable 14x+ EV-EBITDA.  (Its linear cable lower multiple being largely offset by a much higher multiple in its parks, theatrical, and DTC units.)

If I were to make your play I would seek to acquire a diversified basket of WBD, Para, and potentially Disney.

WBD is trading at a 7x EV-EBITDA.  Para is a 10x EV-EBITDA.

WBD is free cash flow positive with a theatrical, and DTC, content pipelines that are being refilled.  Management expects chipping away at $3.75-5B of debt by Q1 2023 ... that would bring its valuation down to an EV-EBITDA multiple of 6x.

Some do have legs, such as railroads and internet stocks, although 90% of stocks are disasters in those sectors. The concept of value is totally missing for many. Many literally have no idea what value is. They see no difference between 50 PE and 500 PE in the same stock.

  
The worst ever, as there were no winners after untold 10s of billions were invested, was pot stocks. Maybe the worst sector in 100 years. Never a single success am aware of.  
What gets me is CNBC will put people on with Tilray 50 times higher than it is today that tout it and no one points out the obvious. If someone came on and said Tilray is now 20 times overvalued but I am playing the greater fool game and expect it to go to 60 times overvalued, then that is fine. But those very people, assuming some are sane, talk concepts to get insanely unaware investors to ruin themselves buying silliness from them at higher prices.  
So AI is the new one. It would be refreshing to hear someone say ""it is overvalued but the hysteria will increase so I am buying here"". On the QQQ indeed bad value, but it had bad value in early 1999 and then doubled by 2-2000.

>Oil giant Shell is doubling down on its focus on fossil fuel profits and attracting investors by announcing plans to increase shareholder payouts and reduce capital investment. The company aims to deliver a 15% dividend increase and stock buybacks of at least $5 billion in the second half of 2023. While expanding its liquefied natural gas business, Shell will also invest in ""low carbon"" technologies such as biofuels, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging, and carbon capture and storage. Notably absent from the announcement were any mentions of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

>Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, emphasized the company's commitment to providing secure energy while transforming to thrive in a low-carbon future. The goal is to create profitable business models that can be rapidly scaled to impact global energy system decarbonization. However, Shell's decision to prioritize fossil fuel investments has faced criticism from investors like the Church of England's pension funds and climate groups who accuse the company of neglecting renewable energy opportunities.

>The International Energy Agency predicts that global demand for oil used in energy will peak in five years. While Shell claims to have met its target to cut oil production ahead of schedule, it continues to face scrutiny regarding its overall production reduction goals. Despite the company's efforts, critics argue that Shell and its competitors are prioritizing profits from oil and gas operations instead of transitioning to renewable energy sources.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14992y4/green_revolution_you_say_shell_is_doubling_down/,rightlibcapitalist,97,1686752303.0,2023-06-14 14:18:23,,,high,Green revolution you say?

jo3t8oh,14992y4,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,">It's no surprise that Shell is focusing on fossil fuels, given that they're one of the world's largest oil and gas companies. However, it's disappointing to see that they're not investing more in renewable energy sources. With global demand for oil expected to peak in just a few years, it's clear that the future belongs to renewables. Hopefully Shell will reconsider its priorities and make a real commitment to clean energy before it's too late.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14992y4/green_revolution_you_say_shell_is_doubling_down/jo3t8oh/,VisualMod,15,1686752318.0,2023-06-14 14:18:38,t3_14992y4,False,inherited,,,,,,0.9760457375086844,0.0,0.023954262491315603,0.791098733432591,0.8

14ibt7j,,post,reddit,StockMarket,"Hey guys, I've been working on a regression analysis algorithm on Python for brazilian stocks using yfinance.

I was curious about the potential of Crude Oil futures (in BRL) to explain Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and Petrorio (PRIO3.SA) returns since both are major players in the oil industry here in Brazil.

Here are the results using test\_size=0.3 and data from August 2021 to June 2023:

reg\_linear(""PETR4.SA"")  
Enter the number of attributes: 1  
Define explanatory variable 1: CL=F  
R-Square: 1.37%  
Mean Absolute Error: 0.01817

reg\_linear(""PRIO3.SA"")  
Enter the number of attributes: 1  
Define explanatory variable 1: CL=F  
R-Square: 23.49%  
Mean Absolute Error: 0.02022

Notice how crude oil returns in BRL have more power to explain PRIO3 than PETR4, even though they are in the same industry. Considering Petrobras is a state owned company and Petrorio is not, I believe the difference comes from political risks translated into the stock's price, more research is needed.

14kihdk,,post,reddit,wallstreetbets,"For those who have followed me, you may remember my post last year warning people not to go too bullish on OPEC's cuts. I explained why they were smoke and mirror. Why you shouldn't expect any return to $122 prices. And why oil prices were actually more likely to go down. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w25s6z/oil\_had\_a\_great\_run\_but\_it\_may\_be\_time\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w25s6z/oil_had_a_great_run_but_it_may_be_time_to/)

And again with the more recent cuts. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people\_betting\_on\_oil\_stocks\_now\_because\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwjx4c/people_betting_on_oil_stocks_now_because_of_the/)

Now oil prices have slipped under $70.

Why have oil prices gone down for a year, when demand is supposed to have picked up with the supply chain and cruises back up, people flying and traveling again, China ending its lockdowns, the energy crisis, sanctions on Russia, and OPEC cutting its outputs?

It's a much more complex picture than that.

You have to look at all the factors at play, the context, the timing, and what's really happening. 

In the first post I explained a lot of the underlying factors that bullish people might have overlooked. 

You have to look at not just what the OPEC output targets are, but what the countries are actually producing. And everything in between from the supply chain to the refineries. 

If people who had called $100+ had looked at those, they would have instead had more expectations below $90. 

# But let's look at the present situation.

There's a ton of factors, and I recommend doing your own research and looking at each one yourself. It's a complex picture, with many moving parts. 

But one of the factors worth mentioning is Russia having to desperately unload its oil for cheap and flooding the market. On top of the gap between output and target cuts, this has also negated any of the few OPEC countries that had any real changes in output.

However, after a year of being bearish on oil prices, I'm no longer as bearish as I once was.

But I'm not bullish yet, just a little less bearish. I just think the downtrend will slow and stabilize. 

...barring any recession, housing market crash, wild OPEC shift, that could re-accelerate the downtrend. 

And that's a big if. Since I'm not feeling positive about the housing market right now, and can really see a correction. That could potentially affect the market demand. 

Plus we are currently in the prime season for oil demand. We'll be heading into the weaker months at the end of the year. 

I can see the downtrend slowing and stabilizing at best. But I'm still not seeing a big come back, or oil prices back above $100 this year.

Maybe next year oil bulls. 

# The stock side

We could however see more positives for the stock side in the energy industry.

This is where I might be even less bearish, and slightly becoming bullish. 

Looking beyond just the commodity side itself, the industry related stocks have actually not been doing that bad, all things considered. XOM, CVX, and Shell, have had somewhat of a stable trend to a mild downward trend for the past year. Smaller stock in things like oil exploration, shale industry, etc... have been a little more volatile. 

If you believe the current stock market rally is part of a long term trend for a next bull cycle, and not a bull trap, then the oil industry related stocks might be worth looking into. There is a potential for a much more positive oil market next year, and maybe more stability as early as this year. 

You also have to believe that there is no further threat of recession or some housing market crash.

And you have to believe that we're not quiet there yet with renewable energy, with electric cars, and that China, India, and Brazil will outpace that with high demand for a lot of fossil fuel vehicles.

15ogbm0,,post,reddit,stocks,"The connection is straightforward: a dip in inflation is largely tied to plummeting energy and food prices.

In July 2023, the average WTI oil price dropped 23.49% as compared with July 2022. Meanwhile, natural gas prices plummeted by 63.31%, and corn by 17.27%. Observing these figures, particularly for natural gas, makes one question the rise in the CPI. The answer there lies in persistent core inflation.

Should commodity prices, especially oil, pivot from dampening overall price growth to driving it, we could anticipate multiple rate hikes from the Fed. In June, WTI's year-over-year decline stood at 38.54%, significantly greater than July's. This partly explains why July's CPI saw a 3.2% YoY growth following June's 3.0%. As we step into August, WTI is a mere 10.07% down from the previous year. If this trajectory holds, the CPI could surge by 4-5% by year-end.

Higher oil prices not only hint at steeper rates, but also increase the odds of an impending recession—a bleak prospect for stocks.

So, will oil prices maintain their ascent?

The IEA predicts an unprecedented global oil demand this year—at 102.2 million barrels daily, with an additional 1 million slated for 2024. Even if we discount the IEA's history of alarmist predictions, this forecast shouldn’t exactly come as a shock, especially when we recall that OPEC+ reliably curtails supply to bolster prices. In July alone, global supply shrank by 910,000 barrels daily due to Saudi Arabia's decision to pull an extra 1 million from the marketplace.

And yet the IEA also anticipates that in 2023, non-OPEC+ supply will climb by 1.3 million barrels daily, dwarfing the cartel's meager 160,000 increase. I'm inclined to anticipate that the market will soon face a surplus, stirring tensions within OPEC+ that will be reminiscent of pre-pandemic dynamics.

However, this development still likely lies a year in the future. Presently, the focus should be on gauging the authenticity of the demand resurgence, with China being the linchpin. Ascertaining the real situation in China always presents challenges. Although oil imports show signs of a revival, that metric doesn't necessarily point to robust demand. China might have just been capitalizing on low oil prices to bolster reserves, a frequent tactic. With prices rising, their excess purchases may taper off.

In essence, while a resurgence to $100 per barrel is conceivable, it likely hinges on geopolitical tensions. A more plausible outlook suggests stabilization within the $70-80 range.",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ogbm0/stocks_feel_the_heat_as_oil_prices_surge/,bitkogan,55,1691777827.0,2023-08-11 18:17:07,,,high,Stocks Feel the Heat as Oil Prices Surge,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ogbm0/stocks_feel_the_heat_as_oil_prices_surge/,33.0,True,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,-1.0360674163436188,0.8823529411764707

1637kl2,,post,reddit,investing,"I do risk management in my profession and as someone who doesn't have a background in economics, I'm trying to figure out which risks have the highest probability. 

It seems like the market sentiment up until a couple weeks ago was that inflation would continue to moderate at a consistent pace, causing interest rates to plateau, and allowing stocks to be favorable.

In my opinion, the chances of inflation moderating at a consistent pace are low. If oil prices spike than wouldn't that cause a ripple effect of interested rates either climbing or staying at the current levels for longer? If that is the case, I would imagine there would be a slow bleed to stocks, especially the cash flow negative ones. 

There's always the chance of an unknown-unknown, Black-Swan event but what would be the most likely knowns to be the catalyst for a sell off? More banks using the repo market and failing? Credit default from commercial real estate or consumers?

I'm interested to here everyone's take. Thanks!

jy1gaj1,1637kl2,comment,reddit,investing,"Oil prices are not a direct component of core inflation. Core inflation are usually price changes for things that are sticky, their prices don't often change and when they do, the price elasticity of demand is low, meaning that people would spend regardless of price. This includes medical expenses, and most obviously shelter. As a result, shelter is over 40% of core CPI.

Thus to predict future core CPI, you would need to predict future shelter inflation. Since the shelter component in CPI is calculated using actual rents, but not asking rents, actual rent changes are lagging asking rents by about 1 year. Thus changes in asking rents right now would correspond to future shelter CPI. The government doesn't really publish data for changes in asking rents, but private companies do, and data right now shows potential shelter CPI in 1 year to be -0.7% YoY as of July. Also good news for core inflation is that MoM asking rent trends is actually below pre-pandemic, when interest rates were much lower.",https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1637kl2/oil_prices_affect_core_inflation_which_affects/jy1gaj1/,tachyonvelocity,8,1693189384.0,2023-08-28 02:23:04,t3_1637kl2,False,inherited,,,,,,0.04706761028552264,0.13421024061870157,0.8187221490957758,-0.055150174650183896,0.4093567251461988

Money creation went nuts in 1940s, 1970s, and 2020s inflation.

k2ywen6,16wt9bj,comment,reddit,finance,"I no longer keep track of large production projects around the globe but my feeling is that the oil producing companies are paying out high dividends and buying back stock rather than looking for new oil particularly new oil in expensive places like deep offshore and Alaska.    Deep Offshore and Alaska projects easily take ten or more years to come on stream so why invest Billion now only to have those projects come on stream into a world of electric vehicles, electric planes, electric trains, electric trucks and so on.   Less expensive exploration and new production they are doing but not at a rate that replaces the depleting reservoirs.   And notice the small frackers are nowhere to be found since they stiffed the banks that backed them when the oil prices dived a couple of years ago.

Eventually demand will drop but it appears that production will drop due to depletion more quickly than demand will drop.   That props up oil prices for a long time.

It was your insightful comment that encouraged me to click the link and study the charts.

That inventory chart, and it’s alarmingly precipitous drop off, seemed to relate to your comment about “depleting reservoirs,”
but now I see there is a difference between “reserves” and “inventory”

k30vht8,16wt9bj,comment,reddit,finance,"Any reservoir gets emptied eventually.   Fracking reservoirs deplete very quickly.   Deeper larger reservoirs more slowly.    So we need to continually find new pools of oil.   Given the long term prediction of less oil being used leading eventually to lower prices new exploration has been cut back for about a decade.   And now new production in the expensive places is simply not being brought on line.    Why spend billions looking for oil that is expensive to produce and will take over 10 years to come online?    Trump let massive amounts of the Gulf of Mexico go up for bid during his term.    76 million acres of leases.   Only 5 million acres received bids sufficient to lead to long term leases.    There is just not much appetite to spend capital that way.  Too expensive and the payback takes years, well over a decade.   So we have declining production, low replacement of that production with new exploration and dropping demand.   But my take is that demand will drop more slowly than production creating a shortage of crude over the short term.   Say the next 10 maybe the next 20 years.    That will result in high prices for crude until that demand drop catches up with the drop in production.",https://reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16wt9bj/are_100_oil_prices_realistic_maybe_not_by_end2023/k30vht8/,Admirable_Nothing,2,1696181324.0,2023-10-01 17:28:44,t1_k30u08s,False,inherited,,,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,-1.1898553620806884,0.7766990291262135
k30ydfb,16wt9bj,comment,reddit,finance,"First off, thank you for your insight and analysis, it is refreshingly clear minded.

A conversion to EVs is very energy demanding, with all the mineral mining, battery production and new manufacturing capacity to be built.

When you see a higher level of oil demand then production over the next 10 to 20 years are you accounting for this necessary energy expenditure?

Do you feel that the bridging of this transition will be smooth or are you expecting turmoil in the pricing as demand spikes are experienced?

A complete transition to EV transport would allow for some 40 to 50% of oil usage reduction (uneducated guess, please advise or correct).  Do you feel that this eventual successful transition, to EVs, will absorb the lost production of oil due to lack of investment etc…

Will the remaining production of oil be enough to sustain the global demand for non transport needs?

In short, what I’m really trying to ask is, will we be ok?  Do you expect that global GDP will have to decrease to match availability of  in ground reserves and available production?",https://reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16wt9bj/are_100_oil_prices_realistic_maybe_not_by_end2023/k30ydfb/,AwwwComeOnLOU,2,1696182326.0,2023-10-01 17:45:26,t1_k30vht8,False,inherited,,,,,,0.20094937110533478,0.06388496595327972,0.7351656629413855,0.09392461229543217,0.8196721311475409

OPEC is purely holding back barrels to drain inventories worldwide. This allows them to control the price ceiling and floor more effectively with their own increases and decreases. 

Not to get political, but it’s largely thought they are going to extreme levels simply because the SPR was used in such drastic fashion. So, if the USA want to add 1 million bbl/d from the reserve for a year, the Saudi’s are saying ok, we will just 1 million barrels/d for a year.

Money, bonds, debt, all of it is made up and gone with the snip of a finger, but energy is real. A barell of crude oil is the equivalent of 5 years of hard human labor.

Since 2010, shale oil is the only source that is growing in domestic crude oil production and it breaks even at 58 dollars a barrell.

Yet the cost of shale oil production is growing 8% a year, for it is harder and harder to get. Instead of printing paper, that is dollar and buying real assets, like crude oil, the US is depleting it's real assets.

Other countries can afford to keep oil in the ground and just move with the rising price of US shale oil production in balance.

There is also a fundamental misunderstanding of raw power in GDP metrics here. GDP in the US is measured with pushing houses, stocks back and forth, consumption and so on. But little actual manufactoring.

k3rqgva,171isrf,comment,reddit,economy,"The decision of whether to extract US oil reserves is made by individual private companies, not by the federal government. While it is true that those companies need the permission of the government in the form of mineral rights and leases and permits, the US does not and historically never has operated in the way you are describing. Those companies are profit maximizers, so the practice of drilling now instead of leaving the oil in the ground is the most profitable approach.

Your question contains some implicit assumptions. It assumes that the total amount of oil reserves in the US is a binding constraint, and it assumes that this oil will be worth more in the future than it is now. 

The first assumption is almost surely not true. There are huge reserves of oil in the US that will likely never be extracted. Some of them are very hard to access and would be prohibitively costly, some of them are in protected areas that we prioritize above the value of the oil, and all of them are subject to the fact that total global demand for oil has likely peaked and will decline going forward. So the US will leave some oil resources in the ground by default.

The second assumption is debatable, but on a long enough time frame it is unlikely to be true. Even under fairly conservative assumptions about future discount rates, if you go far enough out future cash flows are not worth very much compared to current ones. Furthermore, at some point a large portion of the world's current oil consumption will have been replaced by other alternatives. Even if oil remains an important input to industrial processes, it's use as a transportation fuel will decline and probably go to zero eventually.",https://reddit.com/r/economy/comments/171isrf/why_is_the_us_depleting_its_own_oil_reserves_and/k3rqgva/,LastNightOsiris,1,1696626236.0,2023-10-06 21:03:56,t3_171isrf,False,inherited,,,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.9894685227511414,0.5033557046979865

We already pay less for gas than most other countries in the world, and the reason those countries don't complain is because they can still afford to get where they need to go using trains, metro, buses, etc.

It doesn't look like we're aiming for that kind of future, but it does appear we are slowly making more renewable energy vehicles, developing better green tech every year, etc. It wouldn't surprise me if our concern for oil was mostly non-existent within the next 20-30 yrs.

>Cushing  is strategically located to pull in barrels from top U.S. shale fields  and Canada, while its hundreds of tanks are tied to pipelines that  supply U.S. mid-continent and southern refineries and funnel oil to Gulf  Coast export ports.  
>  
>Since hitting a [two-year high in June](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-oil-stocks-cushing-delivery-hub-hit-2-year-peak-2023-06-21/)  of over 43 million barrels, Cushing's levels have tumbled to just under  23 million barrels by Sept. 15, the lowest since July 2022, according  to government data.  
>  
>Analysts  expect as much as a 1 million-barrel draw in the week to Sept. 22,  based on drone monitoring. That would be the majority of an expected 1.7  million-barrel draw in total U.S. crude stocks, according to a Reuters  poll.  
>  
>Tank  storage of below 20 million barrels, or between 10% and 20% of  Cushing's over 98 million barrels of capacity, is considered close to  operational low, say traders. Below those levels the oil is difficult to  remove.

 

>""If  you let the crude (level) drop too low, the crude can get sludgy and  you can't get it out. What does come out - you won't be able to use,""  said Carl Larry, a sales director at energy consultants Wood Mackenzie.  
>  
>Water  and sediments often settle at the base of storage tanks, making the  crude oil at the bottom unable to meet quality standards for refiners or  exporters.  
>  
>Some  tanks have outlets at the bottom that can be used to empty oil and  sludge completely, while others do not and therefore the oil at the base  cannot be removed completely. At lower levels, it becomes more  expensive for companies to get the remaining crude out of the tanks.  
>  
>Roofs  of storage tanks also float on the oil, preventing vapors from building  up or escaping into the atmosphere. When the legs of these roofs touch  the base, it creates a gap between the oil and the roof, causing  combustible vapors to form.

In sept, we were already at crazy lows. Just today tank storage was shown to be at 20 M barrels, we are literally scrapping the bottom of the tanks.

> Cushing inventories rounded out the inventory losses this week with a  1.005 million barrels decline, after falling by 547,000 barrels last  week, leaving an estimated 20.7 million barrels in stock—the lowest  point since 2014.

1. The US SPR is at record lows, US gov has not refilled anything and now we are in 2nd week of War in the mid east
2. Refineries are still in  heavy maintenance through Dec and partially Q1, less draw but once it comes up there is risk of demand once they come back online
3. Any hint of embargo and risk premium will be in play
4. Asia is a massive mid east oil client. japan is 95% mid east for example, they wouldn't source from russia so they would need to purchase from alt sources: US to hedge against embargo risks

k5cfmhs,17aew14,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,">I believe that the oil market is currently undervalued and presents a good opportunity for investment. There are several factors which could lead to an increase in oil prices in the near future:

1) The US SPR is at record lows, and the US government has not been replenishing it. This leaves the country vulnerable to supply disruptions, especially in light of recent tensions in the Middle East.
2) Refineries are still undergoing heavy maintenance through December and into early next year. This will reduce demand for crude oil in the short term, but once refineries come back online there is risk of increased demand as they ramp up production again. 3) Any hint of an embargo on Iranian oil would lead to a significant increase in risk premium, as Asia (which imports a large amount of Middle Eastern oil) would be forced to source from alternative suppliers such as Russia or America. 4) Japan, which relies heavily on imported Middle Eastern oil, would likely purchase additional supplies from America to hedge against any potential embargo risks.  DD Summary: Oil markets are facing increasing risks over the coming months due its low inventory levels combined with strong Asian demand growth prospects .

k5cuqit,17aew14,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"last week traders quit oil and fuels at one of the fastest rates for the past decade.
For context, the last three weeks have seen institutional traders sell a total of 197 million barrels after building positions equaling 398 million barrels over the previous 12 weeks.
Uncertainty about the global economy and fears of a new wave of inflation keeps traders on edge.
Institutional traders are dropping their oil positions as the outlook for the commodity—and the global economy—becomes marred in even more uncertainty.

There has also probably been some profit-taking among hedge funds and other large oil futures market players after oil prices surged above $90 following the latest OPEC meeting earlier this month.The profit-taking started soon after the meeting, but the pace of exiting oil positions has accelerated recently. Reuters’ market analyst and columnist John Kemp reports that last week, traders quit oil and fuels at one of the fastest rates for the past decade, reducing their exposure by a total of 140 million barrels.

For context, the last three weeks have seen institutional traders sell a total of 197 million barrels after building positions equaling 398 million barrels over the previous 12 weeks. OPEC Oil Production Rises In September
Concern about the immediate future of the global economy is certainly one reason for this. The International Monetary Fund said this week higher energy prices would contribute to inflation, stoking the fears. According to the lender, a 10% increase in the price of oil would add 0.4% to inflation, aggravating an already unstable situation in many parts of the world.

“Debt levels are at record levels and at the same time we are in this higher-for-longer interest [rate] environment. There is a lot . . . that could go wrong,” Gita Gopinath, deputy head of the IMF said, as quoted by the FT.

Indeed, speaking of debt, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that for the first time in history, there is uncertainty about the placement of the latest issue of U.S. sovereign debt. There has been a significantly higher than usual supply of Treasury bonds this year, sending U.S. debt to a record, but there are indications that demand may not correspond to that higher demand.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17aew14/wti_oil_at_us_cushing_is_at_levels_not_seen_since/k5cuqit/,Humble-Pineapple-728,5,1697600170.0,2023-10-18 03:36:10,t3_17aew14,False,inherited,,,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,-1.21726930007177,0.5962059620596205

I didn't get where I am by reacting to one-time inventory surpluses triggered by bad weather.

The current bump is partially driven by mid-east instability, but oil companies remain a solid five-year investment.  There is an infrastructure deficit and regulations will prevent further industry infrastructure development.  The SPR is drained.  Saudi has a hard time pumping more now, even when they want to.  And demand is still expected to increase for a couple of decades.

17oihbh,,post,reddit,investing,"It is interesting to me because I have noticed they are trading at reasonable valuations, if not cheap. Many are ignoring, and hedge funds are short as ever.  


I have also noticed that there are cycles in which oil sets a new paradigm price range.  


many of the companies in this industry are buying out competitors right now, and buying back shares with big dividends.  


Warren buffets recent largest purchases are in oil companies.  


Ive put together a few charts on my tradingview account showing that it is unlikely for these assets to underperform the s&p500. In fact, it looks likely that they will outperform from here on out. I focus on Chevron, but any quality company should do well IMO.

18a09bh,,post,reddit,stocks,"OPEC is facing growing challenges in its efforts to boost oil prices amid record output outside the alliance, particularly in the U.S., raising questions about how long the alliance can maintain its deep production cuts. OPEC and its allies, OPEC+, failed to reach a unanimous agreement Thursday on cuts, even after delaying the meeting by five days in an effort to shore up unity within the alliance. Instead, seven members announced voluntary, unilateral cuts to the tune of 2.2 million barrels per day for the first quarter of 2024. 

The outcome is a “bittersweet victory” for OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, wrote Jorge Leon, senior vice president of Rystad Energy, in a note Thursday. Riyadh convinced members to share some of the burden in cutting. But the failure to secure a formal agreement “does not bode well for the group’s unity and cohesion and limits the group’s ability to balance the market,” Leon wrote. 

With oil prices down more than 14% since September highs, traders were hoping that OPEC could provide a boost. So far, however, the cuts are not having the intended effect on oil prices. U.S. crude fell more than 2% Thursday, while Brent dropped 0.3%. Oil futures were down more than 2% on Friday. Traders are disappointed that the cuts are short term, just one quarter, and worried that OPEC+ will not be able to hold itself together, Leon wrote in a note Thursday. 

OPEC+ is increasingly struggling to coordinate large reductions given the size of cuts already in place and the limited impact they are having on prices, JPMorgan analyst Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note Friday. In the end, Saudi Arabia may have only one option — launch a supply war by flooding the market with oil. “They could just add two and a half million barrels into the market for six months and just flush it,” Paul Sankey, a top oil market analyst and president at Sankey Research, said on CNBC’s ” Fast Money ” Thursday. 

Oil below $60 on supply war? The Saudis face two problems — restlessness within the OPEC+ ranks on the cuts and record production outside the alliance, particularly in the U.S. Oil producers outside OPEC+ are pumping oil at record levels and can now cover global demand, which which has forced the Saudi-led alliance to cut to keep the market balanced in their favor, according to Kaneva. John Kilduff, founder of Again Capital, thinks the Saudis are fighting a losing battle with the U.S. Riyadh is currently producing 9 million bpd compared to 13 million bpd in the U.S. And record production outside OPEC comes at a time when demand growth is faltering in China, Kilduff said. “They have a big problem on their hands,” Kilduff said of Saudi Arabia. “They have their hands full and to me it’s not going to prove to be a winning strategy for them,” he said of the output cuts. 

Sankey said the Saudis would need to dramatically slash prices to keep production from growing in the U.S and regain market share. This would require pushing crude below $60 per barrel because that is the price U.S. producers are planning for right now, Sankey said. The Saudis already came close to “burning the house down” this week as they struggled to get OPEC+ members in line, Kilduff said. Given the challenges facing OPEC+, the group’s exit strategy from the current cuts is now in sharp focus, Kaneva wrote in a November note. If Saudi Arabia and Russia return 1.3 million bpd to the market in April, the price of Brent would average $77 per barrel in 2024 and $57 per barrel in 2025, according to Kaneva. This would trigger a slowdown in drilling and fracking activity in the second half of 2024, shaving off about 170,000 bpd of U.S. production growth, she wrote.  In 2025, U.S. liquids production would be flat compared to JPMorgan’s baseline of 740,000 bpd of growth. 

Compliance under scrutiny. For now, the focus is on whether OPEC+ will actually come through with the cuts promised Thursday. The 2.2 million bpd in voluntary cuts from the coalition of the willing is somewhat deceiving. Saudi Arabia, for example, simply rolled over its current 1 million bpd cut, while Russia increased its export curbs – not production – by 200,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd total. In reality, the new cuts to production for the first quarter total about 700,000 bpd total from Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman. 

Goldman Sachs, for its part, declined to change its oil price forecast on the OPEC decision as the investment bank waits for “clarity on compliance with cuts and additional inventories data.” Goldman still expects OPEC to keep Brent in a range of $80 to $100 a barrel in 2024. But compliance with voluntary cuts is a “stress test” of whether Brent will maintain an $80 floor, analyst Daan Struyven wrote. A slowdown in U.S. supply growth in 2024 is another major assumption supporting that price floor. One downside risk to the $80 floor would be persistent upside surprises in crude inventories particularly in the U.S., according to Goldman. Global inventories rose by 300,000 bpd on average in October and November, while Goldman had forecast a decline of 700,000 bpd. And then there is the problem of OPEC unity — or lack thereof. “The further rise in spare capacity and the voluntary nature of today’s cut imply that additional large OPEC+ cuts in response to any additional inventory beats become increasingly difficult to implement,” Struyven wrote.

kbvdt78,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,"> Oil producers outside OPEC+ are pumping oil at record levels and can now cover global demand, which which has forced the Saudi-led alliance to cut to keep the market balanced in their favor, according to Kaneva. 

The two-part problem for the OPEC+ cartel is going to be difficult for them to navigate:

* Member nations need a certain level of oil revenue/profits to balance their own national budgets. Russia is close to trying to fund a total war off of oil revenue, and Nigeria/Angola can't afford to hold back production. Saudi Arabia can voluntarily cut revenue enough to keep prices high, but then they don't get the benefit of high prices when they're not selling enough volume. All the other OPEC and OPEC+ countries need that combination of price and volume to balance their budgets, so they're all hoping that other nations' voluntary cuts support the prices necessary, without having to sacrifice their own volume.
* Producers in non-member nations (and member nations that don't obey the quotas) can free-ride off of OPEC+'s price manipulation to get high volume at high prices. The United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Brazil, Norway, and Kazakhstan are producing a bunch of oil, and its producers love when the Saudis push prices up. (And even though Brazil and Kazakhstan are sometimes geopolitically aligned with OPEC+, that's offset by the fact that OPEC member nation Iraq ignores quotas).

As long as non-OPEC+ production capacity remains high, the OPEC+ nations can't effectively manipulate prices, which will cause dissent within its own ranks.",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18a09bh/saudi_arabia_is_struggling_to_boost_oil_prices/kbvdt78/,Already-Price-Tin,71,1701640733.0,2023-12-03 21:58:53,t3_18a09bh,False,inherited,,,,,,0.06015909090638161,0.4558093771338463,0.4840315319597721,-0.2792825549840927,1.0

kbvmjjw,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,"I'm assuming you're either not from MENA or have never visited any GCC country. Not a single rich GCC country is at risk of falling. In fact the royal families are so deeply entrenched into the country that removing the royal family would destroy the country in the process. Any family that is at risk will have the US come and support it.

Also, and i say this because I used to consult with a B4 in MENA, theres absolutely no way those countries are falling without bringing down the entire world with them. PIF / Mubadala basically funded Silicon Valley and have controlling ownership stakes inultiple large companies across the world. Hell the largest refinery on the US is Saudi owned via Aramco. DP world, UAE GRE, has a controlling share in many important western and eastern ports. These are only a slice of control the GCC have.

Also, Iran's power is limited due to how important of a strategic ally the GCC is for the US / NATO / Europe. There's alot of anti-GCC stuff on reddit but it'd be foolish to think that the GCC does not have a chokehold on the global economy and the world will protect the GCC to maintain status quo. There's a reason that the US has the largest military base in ME in Qatar. It has alot to do with how important the GCC is to maintain economic stability. E.g. Should the GCC depeg its currency from the USD, the consequences will be disastrous.
