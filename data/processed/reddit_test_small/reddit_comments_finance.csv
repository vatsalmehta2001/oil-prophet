k2ywen6,16wt9bj,comment,reddit,finance,"I no longer keep track of large production projects around the globe but my feeling is that the oil producing companies are paying out high dividends and buying back stock rather than looking for new oil particularly new oil in expensive places like deep offshore and Alaska.    Deep Offshore and Alaska projects easily take ten or more years to come on stream so why invest Billion now only to have those projects come on stream into a world of electric vehicles, electric planes, electric trains, electric trucks and so on.   Less expensive exploration and new production they are doing but not at a rate that replaces the depleting reservoirs.   And notice the small frackers are nowhere to be found since they stiffed the banks that backed them when the oil prices dived a couple of years ago.

Eventually demand will drop but it appears that production will drop due to depletion more quickly than demand will drop.   That props up oil prices for a long time.   So I am not only overweight energy, I am nearly exclusively energy/fossil fuel invested.   My kids can diversify after I am gone but that will be well before everyone is driving an EV.",https://reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16wt9bj/are_100_oil_prices_realistic_maybe_not_by_end2023/k2ywen6/,Admirable_Nothing,16,1696142634.0,2023-10-01 06:43:54,t3_16wt9bj,False,inherited

k3idh44,16wt9bj,comment,reddit,finance,"When it comes to flying in a metal tube in the sky, most people are less inclined to trust battery power. Specs on jet fuel are some of the strictest in the country and for good reason - you don’t want the only thing keeping you in the air to crap out on you. Not saying that batteries will crap out, but they’d need significantly high energy density to make electric planes even remotely cost-effective.

It was your insightful comment that encouraged me to click the link and study the charts.

That inventory chart, and it’s alarmingly precipitous drop off, seemed to relate to your comment about “depleting reservoirs,”
but now I see there is a difference between “reserves” and “inventory”

Could you give us some more insight on your views of both?",https://reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16wt9bj/are_100_oil_prices_realistic_maybe_not_by_end2023/k30u08s/,AwwwComeOnLOU,1,1696180807.0,2023-10-01 17:20:07,t1_k30q03w,False,inherited
k30vht8,16wt9bj,comment,reddit,finance,"Any reservoir gets emptied eventually.   Fracking reservoirs deplete very quickly.   Deeper larger reservoirs more slowly.    So we need to continually find new pools of oil.   Given the long term prediction of less oil being used leading eventually to lower prices new exploration has been cut back for about a decade.   And now new production in the expensive places is simply not being brought on line.    Why spend billions looking for oil that is expensive to produce and will take over 10 years to come online?    Trump let massive amounts of the Gulf of Mexico go up for bid during his term.    76 million acres of leases.   Only 5 million acres received bids sufficient to lead to long term leases.    There is just not much appetite to spend capital that way.  Too expensive and the payback takes years, well over a decade.   So we have declining production, low replacement of that production with new exploration and dropping demand.   But my take is that demand will drop more slowly than production creating a shortage of crude over the short term.   Say the next 10 maybe the next 20 years.    That will result in high prices for crude until that demand drop catches up with the drop in production.",https://reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16wt9bj/are_100_oil_prices_realistic_maybe_not_by_end2023/k30vht8/,Admirable_Nothing,2,1696181324.0,2023-10-01 17:28:44,t1_k30u08s,False,inherited
k30ydfb,16wt9bj,comment,reddit,finance,"First off, thank you for your insight and analysis, it is refreshingly clear minded.

A conversion to EVs is very energy demanding, with all the mineral mining, battery production and new manufacturing capacity to be built.

When you see a higher level of oil demand then production over the next 10 to 20 years are you accounting for this necessary energy expenditure?

Do you feel that the bridging of this transition will be smooth or are you expecting turmoil in the pricing as demand spikes are experienced?

A complete transition to EV transport would allow for some 40 to 50% of oil usage reduction (uneducated guess, please advise or correct).  Do you feel that this eventual successful transition, to EVs, will absorb the lost production of oil due to lack of investment etc…

Will the remaining production of oil be enough to sustain the global demand for non transport needs?

In short, what I’m really trying to ask is, will we be ok?  Do you expect that global GDP will have to decrease to match availability of  in ground reserves and available production?",https://reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16wt9bj/are_100_oil_prices_realistic_maybe_not_by_end2023/k30ydfb/,AwwwComeOnLOU,2,1696182326.0,2023-10-01 17:45:26,t1_k30vht8,False,inherited
