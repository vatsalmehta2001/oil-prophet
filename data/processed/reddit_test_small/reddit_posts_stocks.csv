129pcf4,post,reddit,stocks,Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ Makes Surprise 1 Million-Barrel Oil Production Cut,"DUBAI, April 2 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers on Sunday announced voluntary cuts to their production amounting to around 1.15 million barrels per day in a surprise move they said was aimed at supporting market stability.

The group had been largely expected to stick to its already agreed 2 million bpd cuts when its ministerial panel, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, meets virtually on Monday.

Last October, OPEC+, which comprises the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia, agreed output cuts of 2 million bpd from November until the end of the year, angering Washington as tighter supply boosts oil prices.

The U.S. has argued that the world needs lower prices to support economic growth and prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from earning more revenue to fund the Ukraine war.

Sunday's unexpected voluntary cuts, which start from May, come in addition to the ones already agreed in October.

Riyadh said it would cut output by 500,000 bpd while Iraq will reduce its production by 211,000 bpd, according to official statements.

The UAE said it would cut production by 144,000 bpd, Kuwait announced a cut of 128,000 bpd while Oman announced a cut of 40,000 bpd and Algeria said it would cut its output by 48,000 bpd. Kazakhstan will also cut output by 78,000 bpd.

Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak also said on Sunday that Moscow would extend a voluntary cut of 500,000 bpd until the end of 2023. Moscow announced those cuts unilaterally in February following the introduction of Western price caps.

After Russia's unilateral reductions, U.S. officials said its alliance with other OPEC members was weakening, but Sunday's move shows the cooperation is still strong.

The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement that the kingdom's voluntary cut was a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.

Oil prices fell to 15-month lows earlier this month in response to the banking crisis that followed the collapse of two U.S. lenders and resulted in Credit Suisse being rescued by Switzerland's biggest bank UBS.

173y8qf,post,reddit,stocks,Saudi/OPEC led oil embargo?,"Israel has totally blocked food, water and electricity to Gaza and there's a very good chance of a humanitarian crisis. I think there's a real possibility that Gulf nations (Saudis?) will stop the flow of oil to western countries, just like 1973. Not because they care about Palestinians but mostly to avoid domestic backlash and not let Iran appear as their sole savior. This also helps Russia, especially as we approach winter.

Considering existing economic conditions and sanctions imposed on Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan oil the impact of such an embargo will be significant. EV stocks, especially TSLA should rally.

18a09bh,post,reddit,stocks,"Saudi Arabia is struggling to boost oil prices, raising possibility of supply war with U.S.","OPEC is facing growing challenges in its efforts to boost oil prices amid record output outside the alliance, particularly in the U.S., raising questions about how long the alliance can maintain its deep production cuts. OPEC and its allies, OPEC+, failed to reach a unanimous agreement Thursday on cuts, even after delaying the meeting by five days in an effort to shore up unity within the alliance. Instead, seven members announced voluntary, unilateral cuts to the tune of 2.2 million barrels per day for the first quarter of 2024. 

The outcome is a “bittersweet victory” for OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, wrote Jorge Leon, senior vice president of Rystad Energy, in a note Thursday. Riyadh convinced members to share some of the burden in cutting. But the failure to secure a formal agreement “does not bode well for the group’s unity and cohesion and limits the group’s ability to balance the market,” Leon wrote. 

With oil prices down more than 14% since September highs, traders were hoping that OPEC could provide a boost. So far, however, the cuts are not having the intended effect on oil prices. U.S. crude fell more than 2% Thursday, while Brent dropped 0.3%. Oil futures were down more than 2% on Friday. Traders are disappointed that the cuts are short term, just one quarter, and worried that OPEC+ will not be able to hold itself together, Leon wrote in a note Thursday. 

OPEC+ is increasingly struggling to coordinate large reductions given the size of cuts already in place and the limited impact they are having on prices, JPMorgan analyst Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note Friday. In the end, Saudi Arabia may have only one option — launch a supply war by flooding the market with oil. “They could just add two and a half million barrels into the market for six months and just flush it,” Paul Sankey, a top oil market analyst and president at Sankey Research, said on CNBC’s ” Fast Money ” Thursday. 

Oil below $60 on supply war? The Saudis face two problems — restlessness within the OPEC+ ranks on the cuts and record production outside the alliance, particularly in the U.S. Oil producers outside OPEC+ are pumping oil at record levels and can now cover global demand, which which has forced the Saudi-led alliance to cut to keep the market balanced in their favor, according to Kaneva. John Kilduff, founder of Again Capital, thinks the Saudis are fighting a losing battle with the U.S. Riyadh is currently producing 9 million bpd compared to 13 million bpd in the U.S. And record production outside OPEC comes at a time when demand growth is faltering in China, Kilduff said. “They have a big problem on their hands,” Kilduff said of Saudi Arabia. “They have their hands full and to me it’s not going to prove to be a winning strategy for them,” he said of the output cuts. 

Sankey said the Saudis would need to dramatically slash prices to keep production from growing in the U.S and regain market share. This would require pushing crude below $60 per barrel because that is the price U.S. producers are planning for right now, Sankey said. The Saudis already came close to “burning the house down” this week as they struggled to get OPEC+ members in line, Kilduff said. Given the challenges facing OPEC+, the group’s exit strategy from the current cuts is now in sharp focus, Kaneva wrote in a November note. If Saudi Arabia and Russia return 1.3 million bpd to the market in April, the price of Brent would average $77 per barrel in 2024 and $57 per barrel in 2025, according to Kaneva. This would trigger a slowdown in drilling and fracking activity in the second half of 2024, shaving off about 170,000 bpd of U.S. production growth, she wrote.  In 2025, U.S. liquids production would be flat compared to JPMorgan’s baseline of 740,000 bpd of growth. 

Compliance under scrutiny. For now, the focus is on whether OPEC+ will actually come through with the cuts promised Thursday. The 2.2 million bpd in voluntary cuts from the coalition of the willing is somewhat deceiving. Saudi Arabia, for example, simply rolled over its current 1 million bpd cut, while Russia increased its export curbs – not production – by 200,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd total. In reality, the new cuts to production for the first quarter total about 700,000 bpd total from Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman. 

Goldman Sachs, for its part, declined to change its oil price forecast on the OPEC decision as the investment bank waits for “clarity on compliance with cuts and additional inventories data.” Goldman still expects OPEC to keep Brent in a range of $80 to $100 a barrel in 2024. But compliance with voluntary cuts is a “stress test” of whether Brent will maintain an $80 floor, analyst Daan Struyven wrote. A slowdown in U.S. supply growth in 2024 is another major assumption supporting that price floor. One downside risk to the $80 floor would be persistent upside surprises in crude inventories particularly in the U.S., according to Goldman. Global inventories rose by 300,000 bpd on average in October and November, while Goldman had forecast a decline of 700,000 bpd. And then there is the problem of OPEC unity — or lack thereof. “The further rise in spare capacity and the voluntary nature of today’s cut imply that additional large OPEC+ cuts in response to any additional inventory beats become increasingly difficult to implement,” Struyven wrote.

140ycrw,post,reddit,stocks,Is The Bear Market Over? Will The Economy Fool Everyone and Not Go into Recession? Where Do Oil Stocks Go from Here?,"I recently wrote an article that startled me with its reaction. Over 330,000 people read it in two days on Reddit alone. It was We Have Had 2 Recessions And 2 Bear Markets in 3 Years, Will It Be 3 In Just 4 Years?   I suggest reading it first.  It starts with ""I have watched the stock market since the 1970s. Never in my life have I seen so many people think a recession was coming before. Yet this has gone on for about 9 months, and still no recession. ""

This Friday, 6-2-2023, was a breakout day for both the SP500 and the Russell 2000 (small caps).  The SP500 did a Cup and Handle breakout and the Russell a flat bottom base breakout.  The NASDAQ 100 has already broken out, for a while.  Yes, there are all sorts of bad things and stock valuations are poor.  But does that mean the stock market will not go up?  Look at 2020 and 2021 as recent examples of bad problems and extremely high valuations, and the stock market still went up big anyway.  We have had two bear markets in the last 3 years, a rare event. One other factor. Oil stocks are at arguably the best valuations ever and maybe the best sector valuation ever.  The Russell small caps recently made new lows in its ongoing bear market, which after Friday, is maybe over.  The Russell blew away the NASDAQ on Friday, in terms of gains.

What happened on Friday? Well, the debt ceiling was kicked down the road as it always is and the Jobs report fooled everyone again This has been going on for about 9 months now, with almost everyone bearish and expecting a recession.  The jobs market is actually hot.  This was not predicted at all.

I totally agree with people like Danny Moses, Guy Adami, Carter Worth and Dan Nathan that point out all the bad things as they do in this video, but does that mean we will crash, as they have been expecting for months?  They do a good job of making the bear case, but then what happened? The next day the Russell broke out of that range they talked about containing it, on their chart.  YouTube link to that will be in comments.

**So, will the economy fool everyone and not go into recession?  Maybe, and sure has so far.**

**To the last question Where Do Oil Stocks Go from Here?**  This one I am much surer of; in my opinion they will go into a historic bull market.  I have already experienced one, having bought them heavily in 2020 COVID crash.  Received several 10x and 20x movers and just about any oil stock did a 5x in that rally.

Here is a happy story of what is possible in such bull markets in oil stocks.  I bought Cardinal, a Canadian oil stock. Got a 20 bagger and now it has a 1% a month roughly dividend.  Yes, that means I am roughly getting 200% yearly dividends now and have been getting them for a while.  And in the last month have bought more Cardinal. At 1% dividend a month on a 4 PE stock with a CROIC of 30%, it is still a great deal. The valuations are better now than in 2020 for oil stocks.  Back then they were in danger of going under, but dirt cheap.  Now dirt cheap at higher prices, yet much higher safety with wonderful balance sheets and cash flows.

These two charts show that oil stocks are dirt cheap and spending less on CapEx than ever before, as a percent of Cash Flow.  This time is different, they are not overinvesting as they did every time before when oil went over $100.   Again, link in comments.

Eric Nuttal, who runs Canada's biggest oil stock fund, talked about the coming oil stock bull market in a recent video.  About how buybacks can drive a $20 oil stocks to over $1 million a share, unless they go up greatly before the buyouts complete.  Do not scoff, he is right.  He makes the case for oil stocks and high cashflow oil stock buybacks so well in this video, I will not comment myself.  The whole thing is worth viewing, but this link starts where he talks buybacks.

On buybacks will do some math here.  In this case if a stock started at $20 a share, $1 billion FCF and mkt cap of $3 billion = 150 million shares you will get to $1 billion a share in 3 years if 100% of FCF goes to buybacks and stock does not go up before then. If it rerates to 9x FCF after 1 year then was 3x FCF, 33% of stock removed = 100,000,000 shares and $9 billion market cap = $90 a share a 4.5 X gain in one year.

Reality today June 2023 is the best, we have had big buybacks and prices have stayed about the same in last 12 months on oil stocks. Debt is way down, so they have more money for buybacks.

So, let's go 1 more year at current prices. $1 billion FCF is spent buying back stock. That is 50% of stock left, so now just 50,000,000 shares left. Then it goes to 9 FCF (still cheaper than avg stock out there) so $9 billion mkt cap / 50,000,000 shares left = $180 a share, so a X gain. Pretty good.

Let's go 1 more year. Let's say the market was as stupid as it was in 6-2022 to 6-2023 and price stays the same. That means the remaining 50,000,000 shares are bot back, except for just 1 share. Then it goes to 9 X FCF = $9 billion mkt cap and 1 share = $9 Billion a share.  A 450 million times gain.  This will not happen because eventually the market wakes up to how stupid it has been after 10?, 20?, 50? times increase in earnings per share, and it rerates the stock way higher, until it no longer is worth buying back.  In fact, the company might sell some back for 20 times more than they bought it for, if it makes sense to.  Also, if a company gets 2/3s of its stock back, then its EPS going forward, for every Q, will be 3 times higher.

As an example of what can happen with buybacks with far inferior cashflows, and valuations is Teledyne.  George Roberts, who worked alongside Singleton, described the experience like this:

Henry was quoted as saying, with a laugh, “In October, 1972, we tendered for one million shares and 8.9 million came in. We took them all at $20 and figured it was a fluke, and that we couldn’t do it again. But instead of going up, our stock went down. So we kept tendering, first at $14 and then doing two bonds-for-stock swaps. Every time one tender was over the stock would go down and we’d tender again, and we’d get a new deluge. Then two more tenders at $18 and $40.”

The first six buybacks were all in the period from 1972 to 1976. The market reacted adversely to this at first, not understanding what Henry was accomplishing. But as the number of shares went down and the company’s operating income continued to grow, the earnings per share increased rapidly and dramatically. In 1970, net income per share was $1.64. By 1975 it was $6.09 per share; in 1976, $10.79; and in 1977, $16.23 per share.

With the first six stock buybacks, a total of some 22 million Teledyne share were repurchased, reducing the number of outstanding common shares to less than 12 million. A seventh stock buyback offer was made in 1980 and the final one in 1984, at the extraordinarily high price of $200 per share. This was about $30 above the current market price and eight million shares were bought back. By September of that year the stock had climbed to $302 per share and was the highest priced stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

The total value of these buybacks was over $2.5 billion, and more than 85 percent of common shares were retired. Shares outstanding had dropped from 88,827,372 in 1971 to 22,564,756 in 1980. Henry also purchased another 5 percent of Teledyne shares on the open market at various times, bringing the buyback total in the years 1972-1984 to over 90 percent of the company’s shares.

Singleton eventually paid off the debt used to buy back shares. By 1985, net income per share was $46.66. The buybacks created a compounding effect on earnings per share.

Remember oil stocks that are doing, or about to do, buybacks are at about 3-7 times better valuations than Teledyne, so they can compound better.  Teledyne was never in a position to buy back at a fast enough rate, so that all of their stock could be bought back in 3-4 years, just with free cash flow.  So, Teledyne was not even close to being able to do what oil stocks can do today.

An example is Cenovus.  As Nuttal pointed out CVE has committed to 100% of FCF to go to buybacks soon, after debt drops. They can buy back all their stock in less than 4 years, unless the stock rerates higher.  Teledyne was never even close to being capable to do that.

We just got a kicker for oil stocks, one guessed was coming, just a matter of size. 

Sunday (Bloomberg) -- Oil advanced at the week’s open after Saudi Arabia said it will make an extra 1 million barrel-a-day supply cut in July, taking its production to the lowest level for several years following a slide in prices.  
West Texas Intermediate futures jumped almost 5% early in the session before paring some gains to trade near $74 a barrel. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said he “will do whatever is necessary to bring stability to this market” following a tense OPEC+ meeting over the weekend.  
“The oil market now looks like it will be even tighter in the second half of the year,” ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. analysts Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes wrote in a note. “The move by Saudi Arabia is likely to come as a surprise.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/140ycrw/is_the_bear_market_over_will_the_economy_fool/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/140ycrw/is_the_bear_market_over_will_the_economy_fool/,DarpResearch,61,113,1685930006.0,2023-06-05 01:53:26,True,0.5164656771799628,medium
15ogbm0,post,reddit,stocks,Stocks Feel the Heat as Oil Prices Surge,"The connection is straightforward: a dip in inflation is largely tied to plummeting energy and food prices.

In July 2023, the average WTI oil price dropped 23.49% as compared with July 2022. Meanwhile, natural gas prices plummeted by 63.31%, and corn by 17.27%. Observing these figures, particularly for natural gas, makes one question the rise in the CPI. The answer there lies in persistent core inflation.

Should commodity prices, especially oil, pivot from dampening overall price growth to driving it, we could anticipate multiple rate hikes from the Fed. In June, WTI's year-over-year decline stood at 38.54%, significantly greater than July's. This partly explains why July's CPI saw a 3.2% YoY growth following June's 3.0%. As we step into August, WTI is a mere 10.07% down from the previous year. If this trajectory holds, the CPI could surge by 4-5% by year-end.

Higher oil prices not only hint at steeper rates, but also increase the odds of an impending recession—a bleak prospect for stocks.

So, will oil prices maintain their ascent?

The IEA predicts an unprecedented global oil demand this year—at 102.2 million barrels daily, with an additional 1 million slated for 2024. Even if we discount the IEA's history of alarmist predictions, this forecast shouldn’t exactly come as a shock, especially when we recall that OPEC+ reliably curtails supply to bolster prices. In July alone, global supply shrank by 910,000 barrels daily due to Saudi Arabia's decision to pull an extra 1 million from the marketplace.

And yet the IEA also anticipates that in 2023, non-OPEC+ supply will climb by 1.3 million barrels daily, dwarfing the cartel's meager 160,000 increase. I'm inclined to anticipate that the market will soon face a surplus, stirring tensions within OPEC+ that will be reminiscent of pre-pandemic dynamics.

However, this development still likely lies a year in the future. Presently, the focus should be on gauging the authenticity of the demand resurgence, with China being the linchpin. Ascertaining the real situation in China always presents challenges. Although oil imports show signs of a revival, that metric doesn't necessarily point to robust demand. China might have just been capitalizing on low oil prices to bolster reserves, a frequent tactic. With prices rising, their excess purchases may taper off.

In essence, while a resurgence to $100 per barrel is conceivable, it likely hinges on geopolitical tensions. A more plausible outlook suggests stabilization within the $70-80 range.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ogbm0/stocks_feel_the_heat_as_oil_prices_surge/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ogbm0/stocks_feel_the_heat_as_oil_prices_surge/,bitkogan,55,33,1691777827.0,2023-08-11 18:17:07,True,1.0,high
11prsna,post,reddit,stocks,Saudi oil giant Aramco posts record $161 billion profit for 2022,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/12/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-posts-record-161point1-billion-profit-for-2022.html

Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled oil giant Aramco on Sunday reported a record net income of $161.1 billion for 2022 — the largest annual profit ever achieved by an oil and gas company.

Aramco said net income increased 46.5 percent over the year, from $110 billion in 2021. Free cash flow also reached a record $148.5 billion in 2022, compared with $107.5 billion in 2021. 

“This is probably the highest net income ever recorded in the corporate world,” Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said on a Sunday earnings call. 

The results are nearly triple the profit that oil major ExxonMobil posted for 2022, bolstered by soaring oil and gas prices through last year, along with higher sale volumes and improved margins for refined products. 

Oil and gas prices surged at the start of 2022, with western sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine steadily tightening access to Moscow’s supplies, particularly seaborne crude and oil products.

Oil prices have since pulled back more than 25% year-on-year, with hot inflation and rising interest rates overshadowing a more bullish demand outlook from China. Brent and WTI prices fell 6% last week alone. Brent last traded at around $80 dollars per barrel. 

“We are cautiously optimistic,” Nasser said. “If you consider China opening up, the pickup in jet fuels and the very limited spare capacity, we are cautiously optimistic in the short to mid-term [that] markets will remain tightly balanced.”

Aramco raised its fourth-quarter dividend by 4% to $19.5 billion, to be paid in the first quarter of 2023. Aramco also said it would issue bonus shares to eligible shareholders as a result. 

“We’re aiming to sustain [the dividend] at this level,” Aramco Chief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed told the earnings call. “We have the financial strength to go through the ups and downs of the cycle.”

Nasser also used the results release to repeat his warning about “persistent underinvestment” in the hydrocarbons sector. 

“Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real, including contributing to higher energy prices,” Nasser said on Sunday, echoing comments made during a recent interview with CNBC.

At both a ministerial and Aramco level, Saudi Arabia has been a proponent of avoiding short-term fuel shortages through the dual funding of fossil fuel supplies and the green transition.

“We don’t see enough investment getting into the markets right now,” he reiterated on the Sunday call. “We encourage the industry, policymakers, investors… to avail additional investment to really increase the amount in the sector, so that we can meet future demand.”

Aramco said average hydrocarbon production last year was 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 11.5 million barrels per day of total liquids. Saudi Arabia most recently produced 10.39 million barrels per day of crude oil in January, the International Energy Agency found in the February issue of its Oil Market Report.

As chair of the influential OPEC+ producers’ alliance, Saudi Arabia has been leading by example the group’s efforts to collectively reduce their output targets by 2 million barrels per day, agreed in October and reaffirmed at technical and ministerial meetings since. The group’s move towards limiting supply availabilities has put OPEC+ at odds with some international consumers, sparking a war of words with Washington towards the end of the last year, as U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration stressed the need to easing the burden on households.

Long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran on Friday struck a China-brokered deal to resume diplomatic relations. Iran has previously been blamed for a major attack on Aramco’s facilities in 2019 that caused a dramatic spike in prices and undermined the stability of global supplies. Tehran has denied involvement.

“The deal will hopefully result in less geopolitical tension and enhance regional stability, which will definitely have a positive impact on the global market,” Nasser said in response to a question about the Saudi-Iran development.

The company reaffirmed it would continue to invest to increase its maximum production capacity to 13 million barrels a day by 2027.

Capital expenditure rose by 18% to $37.6 billion last year, and is expected to increase to $45 billion to $55 billion in the coming years, anticipating increases “until around the middle of the decade.”

“Our focus is not only on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production, but also investing in new lower-carbon technologies with potential to achieve additional emission reductions in our own operations and for end users of our products,” Nasser said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11prsna/saudi_oil_giant_aramco_posts_record_161_billion/,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11prsna/saudi_oil_giant_aramco_posts_record_161_billion/,Puginator,98,18,1678659699.0,2023-03-12 22:21:39,True,0.35921801234717343,low
