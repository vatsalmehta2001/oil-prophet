US opens the SPR.

At the same time, permitting is expedited, US production is increased (both short and long term) and contracts are made to refill the SPR. If we are still in crisis when those contracts are due, that new production is diverted to the market instead of the SPR.

Basically, if someone produces less, we produce more. That way, people who don't have out best interest in mind can't control the price. The US controls (or at least, heavily influences) the price, using its production and SPR capacity.

P.S.

The government had a ban on exported oil from 1975 to 2015. The constitution grants the Federal government the power to regulate (up to and including a ban) on international trade.

New nuclear is incredibly expensive

[https://www.lazard.com/media/sptlfats/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-150-vf.pdf](https://www.lazard.com/media/sptlfats/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-150-vf.pdf)

Lazard put nuclear in the 131-204 USD/MWh range (unsubsidized), while utility PV is around 28-41 USD/MWh range. Even PV + 4 hours battery is around the 50-60 USD/MW.

&#x200B;

The EIA is much more generous for the nuclear sector, as the nuclear lobby has much more influence in producing it. And it estimates the cost of new nuclear in around 90 USD/MWh.

Simulations to have at least 90% renewable energy, only requires 1.3 overcapacity installation. When solar+wind is at least x3 cheaper, even if you need to build 30% extra, it's still less than half the cost of nuclear. And those simulations are pretty conservative. With better storage technology, and better international connections, it's going to be even easier.

&#x200B;

For example, in Spain we are covering 50% of demand of the first 3 months of 2023 with solar + wind, and Spain is kind of energetically isolated. It isn't like Denmark, that can produce a lot of wind, and export/import from Germany/Sweden whatever it needs when there isn't wind.

Right now, the market says that Solar PV + Wind is muuuuuuuch cheaper than nuclear. All the nuclear power plants built in the West in the last 20 years (France,USA, Finland, France, and Chech Republic) were an economic disaster, with costs x3-5 higher than the initial budget and with a minimum of a decade of delays. All of them except one (Finland) required public money direct, or indirectly. And the only case it was a private company, they cancelled 2 other reactors because of the costs of the first one. The market is very clear, nuclear isn't economical since a long time ago.

&#x200B;

So please, take your time to read on the topic and stop spreading misinformation about the nuclear energy as a future solution. It isn't because it's so expensive.",https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/129yyry/opec_cutting_over_15m_barrels_per_day_in_may/jerqs9v/,GranPino,13,1680518124.0,2023-04-03 10:35:24,t1_jeqkiok,False,inherited

jy1gaj1,1637kl2,comment,reddit,investing,"Oil prices are not a direct component of core inflation. Core inflation are usually price changes for things that are sticky, their prices don't often change and when they do, the price elasticity of demand is low, meaning that people would spend regardless of price. This includes medical expenses, and most obviously shelter. As a result, shelter is over 40% of core CPI.

Thus to predict future core CPI, you would need to predict future shelter inflation. Since the shelter component in CPI is calculated using actual rents, but not asking rents, actual rent changes are lagging asking rents by about 1 year. Thus changes in asking rents right now would correspond to future shelter CPI. The government doesn't really publish data for changes in asking rents, but private companies do, and data right now shows potential shelter CPI in 1 year to be -0.7% YoY as of July. Also good news for core inflation is that MoM asking rent trends is actually below pre-pandemic, when interest rates were much lower.",https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1637kl2/oil_prices_affect_core_inflation_which_affects/jy1gaj1/,tachyonvelocity,8,1693189384.0,2023-08-28 02:23:04,t3_1637kl2,False,inherited

Usually in China things get slow week before and during chinese new year 22.1.2023. Most so called oil&gas expert are sayinh H2 is when things get rolling. 

DVN is my top pick for its great dividend low debt. It has low oil breakeven 30 $ bbl. 

CTRA for it 50% gas, 25% oil, 25 % NGL.
DVN 50 % oil, 25% gas, 25 NGL. 

OKE is my old pick from 2018. Safe midstream company with some gas production. Good dividend but high debt.

As for interest rates I just talking how it affect myself instead other companies. Interest rate at 5% for me means 250€ more for mortgage thus -250€ less for other things. I rather not talk about inflation and interest rates. My understanding about them is just basics.

Here is several names I as oil&gas bull follow in twitter Eric Nuttal, Amrita Sen. They got excellent charts and pictures about oil data. Also check their interview at Youtube. 

Rick Rule is one of my favourites. Look his youtube interview thesis about commodities&energy.
