j7syzvz,10xkwew,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"They had become dislocated. Oil prices fell much more than the stocks did, so now, with some rebound in the prices, the stocks will not correlate as much. They usually correlate with a closer relationship, so this was an uncommon dislocation if you were. Once the two reach a similar equilibrium, I think you will see it go back to normal. 

My theory is that big money knows that the decrease in oil prices is likely temporary and, therefore, they've most held on. Energy companies are still very cheap and many of them have repaired their balance sheets and are adhering to production discipline and shareholder returns.

j7wj4br,10xkwew,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"A commodities value does not guarantee a companies ability to manage a profit. 

Commodities are traded on futures and price locked. Todays price has no meaning on what was actually paid today. 

Oil was at all time highs in 2014 two years later there were more bankruptcies than profitable companies. 

Separate oil/gas from the companies that retrieve and sell them. 

There will always be a correlation, but don't overvalue that correlation. A strung company can sell anything.

k5cuqit,17aew14,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,"last week traders quit oil and fuels at one of the fastest rates for the past decade.
For context, the last three weeks have seen institutional traders sell a total of 197 million barrels after building positions equaling 398 million barrels over the previous 12 weeks.
Uncertainty about the global economy and fears of a new wave of inflation keeps traders on edge.
Institutional traders are dropping their oil positions as the outlook for the commodity—and the global economy—becomes marred in even more uncertainty.

There has also probably been some profit-taking among hedge funds and other large oil futures market players after oil prices surged above $90 following the latest OPEC meeting earlier this month.The profit-taking started soon after the meeting, but the pace of exiting oil positions has accelerated recently. Reuters’ market analyst and columnist John Kemp reports that last week, traders quit oil and fuels at one of the fastest rates for the past decade, reducing their exposure by a total of 140 million barrels.

For context, the last three weeks have seen institutional traders sell a total of 197 million barrels after building positions equaling 398 million barrels over the previous 12 weeks. OPEC Oil Production Rises In September
Concern about the immediate future of the global economy is certainly one reason for this. The International Monetary Fund said this week higher energy prices would contribute to inflation, stoking the fears. According to the lender, a 10% increase in the price of oil would add 0.4% to inflation, aggravating an already unstable situation in many parts of the world.

“Debt levels are at record levels and at the same time we are in this higher-for-longer interest [rate] environment. There is a lot . . . that could go wrong,” Gita Gopinath, deputy head of the IMF said, as quoted by the FT.

Indeed, speaking of debt, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that for the first time in history, there is uncertainty about the placement of the latest issue of U.S. sovereign debt. There has been a significantly higher than usual supply of Treasury bonds this year, sending U.S. debt to a record, but there are indications that demand may not correspond to that higher demand.",https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17aew14/wti_oil_at_us_cushing_is_at_levels_not_seen_since/k5cuqit/,Humble-Pineapple-728,5,1697600170.0,2023-10-18 03:36:10,t3_17aew14,False,inherited

k5cfmhs,17aew14,comment,reddit,wallstreetbets,">I believe that the oil market is currently undervalued and presents a good opportunity for investment. There are several factors which could lead to an increase in oil prices in the near future:

1) The US SPR is at record lows, and the US government has not been replenishing it. This leaves the country vulnerable to supply disruptions, especially in light of recent tensions in the Middle East.
2) Refineries are still undergoing heavy maintenance through December and into early next year. This will reduce demand for crude oil in the short term, but once refineries come back online there is risk of increased demand as they ramp up production again. 3) Any hint of an embargo on Iranian oil would lead to a significant increase in risk premium, as Asia (which imports a large amount of Middle Eastern oil) would be forced to source from alternative suppliers such as Russia or America. 4) Japan, which relies heavily on imported Middle Eastern oil, would likely purchase additional supplies from America to hedge against any potential embargo risks.  DD Summary: Oil markets are facing increasing risks over the coming months due its low inventory levels combined with strong Asian demand growth prospects .
