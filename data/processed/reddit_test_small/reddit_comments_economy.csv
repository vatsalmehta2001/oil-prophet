You're confusing vaccinated with vaccination + latest booster. These are *not* the same thing. The boosters are more like the seasonal flu shot than the original vaccine.

As for my last post, also drum the CDC:

>If you test positive for COVID-19, stay home for at least 5 days and isolate from others in your home.

>After you have ended isolation, when you are feeling better (no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and symptoms improving)...wear your mask through day 10.

The issue that the US industry has is that the refining situation in the US is bad for what the US pumps. 

Largely the US pumps sweet crude. This changes from sour crude with the introduction of fracking. 

The US refining system was mostly built in the 90....before fracking. I'm sure you can see where this is going....we refine mainly sour crude. 

Now the industry could upgrade their plants to do sweet but they don't want to pay for it. In theory the government could force this but that has all lond of issues I'm sure anyone can see. 

What the industry wants is for investors to pay for, similarly to how the original plants were paid for. BUT wallsteet doesn't want to pay for and feels they are still in a good position to extract money from their original investment.

k3rqgva,171isrf,comment,reddit,economy,"The decision of whether to extract US oil reserves is made by individual private companies, not by the federal government. While it is true that those companies need the permission of the government in the form of mineral rights and leases and permits, the US does not and historically never has operated in the way you are describing. Those companies are profit maximizers, so the practice of drilling now instead of leaving the oil in the ground is the most profitable approach.

Your question contains some implicit assumptions. It assumes that the total amount of oil reserves in the US is a binding constraint, and it assumes that this oil will be worth more in the future than it is now. 

The first assumption is almost surely not true. There are huge reserves of oil in the US that will likely never be extracted. Some of them are very hard to access and would be prohibitively costly, some of them are in protected areas that we prioritize above the value of the oil, and all of them are subject to the fact that total global demand for oil has likely peaked and will decline going forward. So the US will leave some oil resources in the ground by default.

The second assumption is debatable, but on a long enough time frame it is unlikely to be true. Even under fairly conservative assumptions about future discount rates, if you go far enough out future cash flows are not worth very much compared to current ones. Furthermore, at some point a large portion of the world's current oil consumption will have been replaced by other alternatives. Even if oil remains an important input to industrial processes, it's use as a transportation fuel will decline and probably go to zero eventually.",https://reddit.com/r/economy/comments/171isrf/why_is_the_us_depleting_its_own_oil_reserves_and/k3rqgva/,LastNightOsiris,1,1696626236.0,2023-10-06 21:03:56,t3_171isrf,False,inherited

Already paid (sunk cost) and helps “stabilizing” (or not increasing) current oil price.

Increases current oil price and helps financing Saudi Arabia (country that recently had disputes with USA, is actively trying to spike oil prices and announced plans for MDW investigation plans)

Fracking is a new technique and if that technique didn't exist, we would rely on foreign oil. 

That's it. 

The local companies utilized fracking to extract as much oil as possible on the land they ALREADY EXTRACTED OIL. Fracking is actually a relatively new technique.

So, the U.S. can't really tell these companies to STOP producing oil.
