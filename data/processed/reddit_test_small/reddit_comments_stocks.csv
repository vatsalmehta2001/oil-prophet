jepn69l,129pcf4,comment,reddit,stocks,"Biden & his administration have been trying to drive oil prices down by releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, pressuring other countries to produce more, approving more oil fields to open. 

The problem is that prices are climbing because of increasing and historic levels of energy demand. There is no emphasis on restraint of energy consumption, or consumption of any type. 

In this situation, the only restraint on energy consumption IS high prices. This is why environmentalists have been trying to shut down oil fields and restrict production all these years. High energy prices are the cure for excessive energy demand.

By increasing production and suppressing oil & gas prices, Biden is engaging in straight up climate change denier policy, and promoting more energy consumption.

> I guarantee you 100% you people would be blaming him for higher prices if he didn't do what he did.

Of course they would. Because online communities are only for climate change mitigation when it consists of promoting Tesla & EVs and other cool technology.

kbvdt78,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,"> Oil producers outside OPEC+ are pumping oil at record levels and can now cover global demand, which which has forced the Saudi-led alliance to cut to keep the market balanced in their favor, according to Kaneva. 

The two-part problem for the OPEC+ cartel is going to be difficult for them to navigate:

* Member nations need a certain level of oil revenue/profits to balance their own national budgets. Russia is close to trying to fund a total war off of oil revenue, and Nigeria/Angola can't afford to hold back production. Saudi Arabia can voluntarily cut revenue enough to keep prices high, but then they don't get the benefit of high prices when they're not selling enough volume. All the other OPEC and OPEC+ countries need that combination of price and volume to balance their budgets, so they're all hoping that other nations' voluntary cuts support the prices necessary, without having to sacrifice their own volume.
* Producers in non-member nations (and member nations that don't obey the quotas) can free-ride off of OPEC+'s price manipulation to get high volume at high prices. The United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Brazil, Norway, and Kazakhstan are producing a bunch of oil, and its producers love when the Saudis push prices up. (And even though Brazil and Kazakhstan are sometimes geopolitically aligned with OPEC+, that's offset by the fact that OPEC member nation Iraq ignores quotas).

As long as non-OPEC+ production capacity remains high, the OPEC+ nations can't effectively manipulate prices, which will cause dissent within its own ranks.",https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18a09bh/saudi_arabia_is_struggling_to_boost_oil_prices/kbvdt78/,Already-Price-Tin,71,1701640733.0,2023-12-03 21:58:53,t3_18a09bh,False,inherited

kbvmjjw,18a09bh,comment,reddit,stocks,"I'm assuming you're either not from MENA or have never visited any GCC country. Not a single rich GCC country is at risk of falling. In fact the royal families are so deeply entrenched into the country that removing the royal family would destroy the country in the process. Any family that is at risk will have the US come and support it.

Also, and i say this because I used to consult with a B4 in MENA, theres absolutely no way those countries are falling without bringing down the entire world with them. PIF / Mubadala basically funded Silicon Valley and have controlling ownership stakes inultiple large companies across the world. Hell the largest refinery on the US is Saudi owned via Aramco. DP world, UAE GRE, has a controlling share in many important western and eastern ports. These are only a slice of control the GCC have.

Also, Iran's power is limited due to how important of a strategic ally the GCC is for the US / NATO / Europe. There's alot of anti-GCC stuff on reddit but it'd be foolish to think that the GCC does not have a chokehold on the global economy and the world will protect the GCC to maintain status quo. There's a reason that the US has the largest military base in ME in Qatar. It has alot to do with how important the GCC is to maintain economic stability. E.g. Should the GCC depeg its currency from the USD, the consequences will be disastrous.

Not that there won’t be a blow up in the dollar because of all this dollar denominated debt as other countries look elsewhere in the short term, but after that will be ugly if they don’t want it anymore, and we continue this path this will be the case, it’s not even arguable except by neolibs who think tomorrow will always look like yesterday because they don’t know their history and they don’t want to believe the facts.

jn0psem,140ycrw,comment,reddit,stocks,"Disney has a linear cable problem, especially with ESPN.  Netflix is not bogged down by the burden and can double down on its content/growth initiatives.

That being said Netflix is already being richly rewarded in the public market ... increasingly so each day.  24x+ EV-EBITDA.

Disney is at a more manageable 14x+ EV-EBITDA.  (Its linear cable lower multiple being largely offset by a much higher multiple in its parks, theatrical, and DTC units.)

If I were to make your play I would seek to acquire a diversified basket of WBD, Para, and potentially Disney.

WBD is trading at a 7x EV-EBITDA.  Para is a 10x EV-EBITDA.

WBD is free cash flow positive with a theatrical, and DTC, content pipelines that are being refilled.  Management expects chipping away at $3.75-5B of debt by Q1 2023 ... that would bring its valuation down to an EV-EBITDA multiple of 6x.

This week’s notional net selling in US Energy was the largest in 10 weeks and ranks in the 97th percentile vs. the past five years,"" Goldman analysts wrote, as quoted by ZeroHedge, which predicted that the short-selling is about to reverse in light of the latest OPEC+ moves.  
  
According to Rystad Energy’s senior vice president of oil market research, Jorge Leon, the Saudi oil output cut would only have a short-term effect on market prices unless it was extended beyond July, when it will enter into effect.  
The additional cut, he told the AP, provides “a price floor because the Saudis can play with the voluntary cut as much as they like.”

jn8xt1f,140ycrw,comment,reddit,stocks,"There is one mass formation psychosis event after another in the market, some people live in them full time, if it is not hysteria they are not interested.

  
Some do have legs, such as railroads and internet stocks, although 90% of stocks are disasters in those sectors. The concept of value is totally missing for many. Many literally have no idea what value is. They see no difference between 50 PE and 500 PE in the same stock.

  
The worst ever, as there were no winners after untold 10s of billions were invested, was pot stocks. Maybe the worst sector in 100 years. Never a single success am aware of.  
What gets me is CNBC will put people on with Tilray 50 times higher than it is today that tout it and no one points out the obvious. If someone came on and said Tilray is now 20 times overvalued but I am playing the greater fool game and expect it to go to 60 times overvalued, then that is fine. But those very people, assuming some are sane, talk concepts to get insanely unaware investors to ruin themselves buying silliness from them at higher prices.  
So AI is the new one. It would be refreshing to hear someone say ""it is overvalued but the hysteria will increase so I am buying here"". On the QQQ indeed bad value, but it had bad value in early 1999 and then doubled by 2-2000.

  
My guess on this issue is even though overvalued, due to negative sentiment it will go higher here on SPY and RUT and is severely undervalued on Oils and will go way way higher on them.
